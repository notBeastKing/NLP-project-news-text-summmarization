'Undermining our region’s stability': PDP slams Omar Abdullah for calling to scrap Indus Waters Treaty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/undermining-our-regions-stability-pdp-slams-omar-abdullah-for-calling-to-scrap-indus-waters-treaty/articleshow/121244189.cms,"Omar Abdullah (left), and Mehbooba Mufti

NEW DELHI: The People's Democratic Party (PDP) on Saturday criticised Jammu & Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah for his recent comments about the Tulbul Navigation Project and the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). The party said such remarks could affect the ""fragile"" peace and ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC).""Omar Abdullah’s remarks invoking the Tulbul Navigation Project and the control of water flow across the border are not just ill-timed but deeply irresponsible. At a moment when peace is fragile and the ceasefire is barely holding, such provocations only serve to inflame tensions,"" the PDP said in an official statement.The PDP also referred to a 2002 resolution on the IWT in the Jammu and Kashmir legislative council. It said, ""The resolution was moved by an NC MLC, not the PDP. It passed solely because the National Conference held a majority in the Upper House.""This response followed a recent exchange between Omar Abdullah and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti. The two leaders commented on the possible resumption of the Tulbul Navigation Project after the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty.The argument began when Abdullah posted on Thursday about restarting construction on the Tulbul Navigation Barrage at Wullar Lake. He wrote, ""The Wular lake in North Kashmir. The civil works you see in the video is the Tulbul Navigation Barrage. It was started in the early 1980s but had to be abandoned under pressure from Pakistan citing the Indus Water Treaty. Now that the IWT has been 'temporarily suspended' I wonder if we will be able to resume the project,"" on his X handle.Mufti shared Abdullah's post and replied, ""At a time when both nations have just stepped back from the brink of war—with Jammu and Kashmir once again paying the highest price through loss of innocent lives, destruction, and suffering—such provocative statements are deeply irresponsible.""Meanwhile, the PDP in its official statement described Abdullah’s comments on the IWT as ""dangerous and short-sighted."" It said such remarks could raise tensions and harm people especially in border areas.""Our position is clear: We continue to demand fair compensation under the treaty to Jammu and Kashmir, but the IWT must not be used as a pretext for war rhetoric,"" the PDP said.The party also said, ""Introducing contentious issues like the Tulbul Project or the abrogation of the IWT in today’s volatile climate only pushes both countries closer to further confrontation. Those in J&K advocating such positions are undermining our region’s stability, jeopardizing the lives of our people living in the border states who suffer most when conflict escalates, and, most importantly, India’s interests.""","The party said such remarks could affect the ""fragile"" peace and ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) This response followed a recent exchange between Omar Abdullah and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti. The two leaders commented on the possible resumption of the Tulbul Navigation Project.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121244202,imgsize-1199276,width-400,resizemode-4/erf-5.jpg"

Government's diplomatic outreach team: Congress has tough call to take as rift with Shashi Tharoor widens,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-has-tough-call-to-take-as-rift-with-mp-widens/articleshow/121244151.cms,"Congress has tough call to take as rift with Shashi Tharoor widens

‘Jealousy?’ BJP asks why Cong didn’t pick Tharoor

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor ’s acceptance of the government nomination to lead a global outreach team , coming close on the heels of his comments about the conflict with Pakistan, including a defence of PM Modi government on the Pahalgam attack , and complaints at the Congress Working Committee meeting that he was straying from the party line, tantamount to daring the party, if not defying it.Congress has a lot to mull while deciding about Tharoor, crucial being the upcoming elections in Kerala where it is facing a tough challenge from the ruling Left front as well as from BJP’s bid to cut into Congress’s vote bank.In a democratic system, when individual MPs are sent on an official delegation, MPs should seek the concurrence of the party,” Jairam Ramesh said, calling it “dishonest” and “downright mischievous” for the government to request nominees after possibly deciding them on its own.However, its protest lost the sting with Tharoor gladly accepting the nomination. Formerly a senior functionary with the UN, Tharoor has also served as junior external affairs minister and was recommended by Congress last year to head the standing committee on foreign affairs. “It is an honour,” he said, adding that the issue involved national interest and should not be seen through the prism of partisan politics.Significantly,Congress’s partners in INDIA alliance — DMK ’s Kanimozhi and NCP ’s Supriya Sule — did not turn down invitations to be part of the delegations. Other delegations will be led by Ravi Shankar Prasad (BJP), Sanjay Jha (JDU), Shrikant Shinde (Shiv Sena) and Baijayant Panda (BJP).Government had on Friday rejected Congress’s claim that it had the sole prerogative of deciding who from the party should be part of the delegations. “This has not to do with party politics,” minister for parliamentary affairs Kiren Rijiju is learnt to have told the Congress leadership, sources said.Congress’s stand drew an angry response from BJP. “ Congress choices to represent India at diplomatic meetings are not just intriguing — they are deeply questionable. Take, for instance, the inclusion of Syed Naseer Hussain. Let’s not forget — it was his supporter who raised ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ slogans inside the Vidhana Soudha while celebrating his Rajya Sabha victory. Bengaluru police arrested three individuals in connection with the incident...,” Amit Malviya, head of party’s IT cell, said on X. He added “the less said about Gaurav Gogoi, the better”, pointing out that the deputy leader of Congress in LS had spent 15 days in Pakistan, with his departure and arrival duly logged at the Attari crossing.Malviya also said, “No one can deny Shashi Tharoor’s eloquence, his long experience as a UN official, and his deep insights on matters of foreign policy. So why has the Congress Party — and Rahul Gandhi in particular — chosen not to nominate him. Is it insecurity? Jealousy? Or simply intolerance of anyone who outshines the ‘high command’?”",Congress has a lot to mull while deciding about Tharoor.

BIJNOR: A 30-year-old constable died while attempting to rescue suspects after a high-speed chase ended with the criminals’ vehicle plunging into a canal near Bijnor city, reports Harveer Dabas.Despite suffering a electric shock upon entering the water, unknowingly electrified by live wires that had snapped during the crash, the constable managed to alert his colleagues to the danger, preventing further casualties, police said on Saturday.Officers said the suspects were celebrating the release of a friend from jail and were driving recklessly when they collided with a truck. Villagers alerted the police when the group assaulted the truck driver and fired at him.Bijnor SP Abhishek Jha said, “A police response vehicle and local units responded immediately, initiating a high-octane chase. The suspects’ vehicle sped along the Salmabad-Bharera road before crashing into a high-tension electric pole and plunging into a nearby canal, snapping the power wires that fell into the water.”He added, “Constable Manoj Kumar and head constable Gangaram dove into the canal to arrest the suspects. They didn’t know the water was electrified. The power supply was cut immediately, and the officers were pulled out and rushed to a hospital. Kumar, a native of Haiba village in Baghpat district, succumbed to his injuries while Gangaram remains hospitalised.”Praising the constable’s bravery, Jha said, “Manoj didn’t just risk his life but also saved six of his fellow officers. Even while suffering shock, he managed to alert them. His final act was one of true bravery.” Manoj joined the force in 2016. He is survived by his 28-year-old wife and their five-year-old son. On Saturday, officers from across the district gathered to honour him with a full police funeral.Meanwhile, police arrested one of the suspects, Neeraj Kumar — a history-sheeter with a prior attempt to murder charge — at the scene. Another accused, Veerbhan alias Veeru from Moradabad, was nabbed after a brief encounter.A country-made pistol, a live round and a spent cartridge were recovered from the spot. Two suspects are absconding, and legal proceedings are currently underway, officers said.","Constable Manoj Kumar died while attempting to rescue suspects after a high- speed chase ended with the criminals’ vehicle plunging into a canal near Bijnor city.

HC upholds appointment of AMU’s 1st woman vice-chancellor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-upholds-appointment-of-amus-1st-woman-vice-chancellor/articleshow/121242119.cms,"Allahabad High Court has validated professor Naima Khatoon's appointment as Aligarh Muslim University's Vice-Chancellor, dismissing challenges to the selection process.

Khatoon says HC ruling reaffirmation of democratic values

AGRA: Dismissing all petitions that challenged the selection process, Allahabad high court upheld the appointment of professor Naima Khatoon as the vice-chancellor (VC) of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) on Saturday. Khatoon, who earlier served as principal of women’s college in AMU, became the first woman to hold the VC’s post in the varsity’s over 100-year history, reports Mohammad Dilshad.HC division bench of Justice Ashwani Kumar Mishra and Justice Donadi Ramesh found no procedural lapses, asserting the selection process adhered fully to the AMU Act, statutes and regulations. The court also emphasised the symbolic and progressive nature of her “historic appointment”, calling it a “major stride for gender representation and constitutional values in academic leadership”.The HC division bench of Justice Ashwani Kumar Mishra and Justice Donadi Ramesh further recognised that the “final discretion to appoint the VC lay with the ‘visitor’ of the university — the President of India, and no allegations of mala fide were established at that level”. The court had reserved the verdict on April 9 after hearing arguments from counsels representing the petitioner, AMU and the central govt.The petitions were filed in late 2023 by Prof Syed Afzal Murtaza Rizvi of Jamia Millia Islamia, Mujahid Beg from AMU’s medicine department and retired AMU prof M U Rabbani.They had raised objections after Khatoon, wife of then acting VC Mohd Gulrez, was “shortlisted” for the post.After HC’s decision, Khatoon, said, “I’ve always had the highest regard and faith in our judiciary. This verdict is not just a personal vindication, but a strong reaffirmation of institutional processes and democratic values in our higher education system. Let this judgment inspire confidence among all stakeholders and reaffirm our shared mission to uphold the university’s legacy of knowledge, justice and progress.”In Nov 2023, controversy erupted after the AMU’s executive council shortlisted “five eligible names”. An AMU professor wrote to the President, claiming “the process of selecting a new VC was not followed”. The ‘AMU court’ then forwarded three names, including that of Khatoon, to the ministry of education and the President, and the matter also went to HC.","Allahabad High Court has validated professor Naima Khatoon's appointment as Aligarh Muslim University's Vice-Chancellor.

The inside story of a seamless Operation Sindoor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-inside-story-of-a-seamless-operation-sindoor/articleshow/121241911.cms,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to the Adampur Air Base in Jalandhar.

Operation Sindoor

Resolute political will

Choice of targets

Closing intel gap

They knew it was coming

Choice of weapons

Air defence held firm

Threat within Pakistan

Missing ‘strategic depth’

Navy, the amplifier

Staying the course

Wars always generated a fog of claims and counter-claims. Did the Americans deliberately target civilians? Did a cynical Saddam Hussein use hospitals and schools as shields? It was always difficult to sift the truth from the lies, but the problem now has become even more acute with that much more information manipulation by the combatants.During Operation Sindoor, the same game played out, but one thing has now become abundantly clear: India won the latest round decisively. Indian armed forces have given enough information, backed by photographs and satellite images, leaving little room for disputes by sceptics and biased pundits masquerading as objective neutral parties. The assertions have been backed by independent military strategists and experts.TOI, based on accounts from multiple high-level insiders, who obviously spoke on the condition of anonymity, pieced together how India executed Operation Sindoor.Prime Minister Narendra Modi was busy with his engagements in Saudi Arabia when news of the attack on tourists in Pahalgam started trickling in. As soon as the magnitude of the massacre — the sheer monstrosity of the act, the fact that only Hindu men were targeted — was clear, Modi made up his mind that this would not go unpunished.The terrorists had even taunted wailing family members of victims that this was a message to Modi. The PM cut short his visit and on the way back told his colleagues to start preparing for retaliation against terrorists and their patrons.The consultations in the Cabinet Committee on Security and with the defence and intelligence leadership were not about “if” we should retaliate. It was solely focused on “where and when”, sources told TOI. In 2019, Modi had called Pakistan ’s nuclear bluff when he ordered the air strike on the jihadi hub of Balakot in response to the Pulwama attack on a CRPF convoy.He was determined not to let that be an obstacle this time around as well despite alarmist predictions about Pakistan army chief Gen Asim Munir being a jihadi in olives who had a restless finger on the nuclear button. India also factored in that China and Turkiye were standing by Pakistan, that a large number of Indian troops were stationed along the China border, and also that the West was again getting spooked by Pakistan’s scare-mongering. None of this dimmed India’s resolve which was articulated by the PM in Madhubani.The 2016 surgical strikes after the terror attack at an Army camp in Uri signalled the intent not to let the LoC come in the way of India’s pursuit of justice. The govt climbed up a couple of steps in the escalation ladder through the air strike on Balakot — a revered spot in the jihadi imagination.This time, the message had to be stronger and, hence, the selection of Muridke and Bahawalpur, the headquarters of Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, which had been responsible for almost all the major terror attacks on India, beginning with the audacious one on Parliament in 2001 and including the amphibious army-type assault on Mumbai in 2008. The headquarters of Hizbul Mujahideen and other areas in POK, which were the staging ground for attacks, were part of the ‘to-hit’ list drawn up with the help of meticulous intelligence the govt already had.Forty-odd buildings were priority targets and the objective was to inflict damage that was visible, lethal and served to amplify the message: “We know who you are, where you are and how to get you.gPainstaking intelligence gathering over the past 10 years has helped India take care of what has for decades been a major handicap vis-a-vis its hostile neighbour. The success of Operation Sindoor only served to confirm what had been speculated over the past couple of years: that India has closed the intelligence gap.A combination of humint and techint helped India pin the exact locations, down to the buildings that served as the residential quarters of the leaders of Lashkar and Jaish inside the sprawling complexes at Muridike and Bahawalpur. Ten members of the family of Masood Azhar died. He himself barely escaped an Indian missile. Such was the extent of the losses that the Pakistan army had to depute its senior ranks to attend their funeral: an act of solidarity which blew apart the fiction of jihadi outfits being non-state actors.Uri and Balakot had left little room for doubting the Modi govt’s intent. Right after the Pahalgam attack, speculation was rife that India would target terror hubs, especially the jihadi universities at Muridke and Bahawalpur. It was also certain that Pakistan, caught napping twice, would have ramped up defences around its “prized assets”, thus eliminating the room for India to spring a surprise. Yet, two weeks after the Pahalgam massacre, India decided to hit the very same targets. Sources refused to confirm if it was because our intelligence had signalled that Pakistan had lowered its guard. It certainly created a “bol ke mara, jo kaha so kiya” moment for the govt and the forces.Intelligence also helped India exploit a chink in Pakistan’s air defence. The Rawalpindi GHQ and their Chinese handlers had designed a shield to defeat any attack that involved planes and missiles. But they did not take into account India’s stock of loitering munitions (a type of drone). A deadly addition to the inventory, loitering munitions fly at low altitude to dodge regular air defence, hunt and hover over the target with exact coordinates fed into it, before striking with precision.Over the past few years, India has built an impressive arsenal of the stealth weapon, largely sourced from overseas through the Emergency Purchase route, but now increasingly being produced domestically too. Combined with longrange Made-in-India drones, they took a heavy toll on the nine terror targets. Once they had got the “free hand” from the PM, defence and intelligence officers started working on the execution of Operation Sindoor.What helped them were multiple simulations the three Services had run, enabling near-perfection in the implementation. The four-day operation saw them work together: a perfect example of the muchaspired-for “jointness” that India has sought to achieve in recent years. There is speculation that some of the most ferocious strikes were achieved through weapons fired by Navy personnel.The destruction near Lahore of the HQ-9 missile defence system, a copycat version of the Russian S-300, and a strategic gift from China, marked a major blow to Pakistan, both materially as well as psychologically. But this was only a prelude to the major unravelling of Pakistan’s air defence.Their air bases, including strategic ones, which are home to F-16s and Chinese-made J-10s, and those located next to the headquarters of Strategic Plans Division that handles their nukes, became vulnerable. Open to missile and drone attacks, it exposed the hollowness of Bunyanum Marsoos, the ‘wall of lead’ that Pakistanis had claimed to have built. As against this, India’s own air fortification remained intact.A combination of the legacy antiaircraft guns, surface-to-air missiles, particularly the portable ones, battle-proven Pechoras, indigenously developed Akash, and S-400 that India acquired from Russia in 2018 in defiance of US’s threat of sanctions, turned out to be “the wall”. In another example of jointness, the capabilities of the Indian Air Force and the Army were supplemented by those of the Navy.As a result, all our air bases remained safe and operational. Pakistan’s claims about the destruction of the Adampur air base were proven to be fiction on Tuesday when Modi landed there on his special plane to address the jawans, with S-400 Triumph batteries forming a defiant backdrop. The military success announced India’s fullscale readiness for new-age warfare and will go a long way in enhancing confidence of the armed forces in “Make-in-India” weapons.Pakistan had limited options of widening the theatre of war by opening a front on the land border. With the Baloch insurgency developing into a front within, Gen Asim Munir could have withdrawn the Chaklala-headquartered X Corps — tasked with defending Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir — from Balochistan, but only at a huge risk. Attacks by Balochistan Liberation Army, even during the hostilities with India, only further shrank the space for manoeuvre.The vulnerability of Pakistan’s skies and the high possibility of Baloch snipers aiming at long convoys meant that the 26 division — the mechanised division based in Bahawalpur — could not be brought to the border either.Pakistan had wanted to turn Afghanistan into a client state, hoping that its control over its neighbour would give it strategic depth in any confrontation with a conventionally superior India. The retreat of the US and the installation of a Taliban regime was supposed to be the fulfilment of the dream of the planners at Rawalpindi GHQ.Unfortunately for them, the new regime in Kabul has refused to be pliant and an accessory, leading Islamabad to ironically accuse them of not controlling Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan. It has also made it necessary for Pakistan to deploy a sizeable number of its troops in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan. Staunch solidarity of the majority in KP with jailed former PM Imran Khan and the fear that his supporters would erupt in the streets against the Pakistan army further tied Islamabad’s hands.It did not join the action as such. But its offensive posture clearly signalled India’s intent and readiness to respond to any escalation. Ships resorted to aggressive manoeuvres on a night when Indian missiles had hit targets in Karachi’s immediate vicinity.The message was that India was more than willing to broaden the theatre to cover all domains, and Pakistan got the message. As Vice Admiral AN Pramod said, the Indian Navy ensured that the enemy’s air force remained “bottled up” on the Makran coast.Stoking the West’s fears of a nuclear conflagration and capitalising on it has for decades been Pakistan’s playbook. The tactic was deployed again and it worked, with Western capitals offering unsolicited counsel to New Delhi to de-escalate. The Modi govt, however, refused to flinch and maintained that terrorists needed to be made accountable and India has the right to defend its citizens. The message, in its most stark form, was conveyed by the PM to US vice-president J D Vance on the evening of May 9. Vance had called to convey “intelligence” about Pakistan planning a massive retaliation.“They can do whatever they are planning to, but India’s response will be even stronger,” Modi is learnt to have told Vance. That Modi really meant “goli ka jawab gole se” became evident in hours. After the IAF humiliated Pakistan by hitting its prized air bases, external affairs minister S Jaishankar got a call from US secretary of state Marco Rubio on Saturday morning, saying that Pakistan was ready to discuss a ceasefire.India’s first response was to escalate the strikes on Pakistan’s air bases before its Director General of Military Operations Lt General Rajiv Ghai decided to connect with his counterpart Maj Gen Kashif Abdullah. The biggest takeaway for Pakistan and the world at large: Since the global community is unable or unwilling to force Pakistan to change its behaviour, India is ready to execute the task on its own, despite significant risks. And it is sure the people will back a govt that is ready to go to the farthest lengths.",Prime Minister Narendra Modi was busy with his engagements in Saudi Arabia when news of the attack on tourists in Pahalgam started trickling in.

Supreme Court Criticizes Repeated PILs on Rohingya Deportation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-irked-by-repeated-pils-to-stop-rohingya-deportation/articleshow/121220210.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday was irked by successive attempts through PIL to stop alleged deportation of Rohingya Muslims within a fortnight and told senior advocate Colin Gonsalves that he can’t be filing PIL after PIL on the same issue without any new fact to seek modification of SC’s May 8 decision refusing relief.On May 8, a bench of Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and N Kotiswar Singh had refused to grant interim stay on apprehended deportation of Rohingyas despite spirited arguments from Gonsalves and Prashant Bhushan. The bench had said Rohingyas, who are not Indian citizens, do not have a right to reside anywhere in the country.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta had said India is not a signatory to the UN Convention on Refugees and disputed validity of UNHCR granting refugee status to Rohingyas, who are from Myanmar and had fled to other countries because of serious threat to their lives from the military.On Friday, Gonsalves said on May 8 itself the Union govt had deported 28 Rohingyas, who were handcuffed and taken to Andaman Island, given life jackets and pushed towards Myanmar. After somehow reaching Myanmar, they took help of fishermen to make phone calls to their relatives in Delhi to inform them that they faced imminent threats to their lives.The bench of Justices Kant and Singh said these are bald averments and who is there to verify these facts are true to his knowledge. “When the country is facing such a situation at present, you cannot come up with fanciful PILs like this. There is no material to support vague and sweeping allegations made in the petition. Unless the petitioner provides prima facie credible material, it is difficult to pass an interim order which is contrary to the one refused on May 8 by a 3-J bench.”Gonsalves cited a SC judgement on protection of Chakma refugees to seek similar relief for Rohingyas. He also cited a UN Report as well as an order of the International Court of Justice to claim that Rohingyas are not migrants but refugees whose protection of lives is mandated by the UN.The bench said, “We do not want to comment on the UN Report today. We will give an answer to that on July 31, when this petition along with the pending one would be taken up for hearing.” Gonsalves said this would allow govt to deport more Rohingyas, whose number exceed 8,000 in different parts of the country and 800 of them are in Delhi.","Supreme Court irked by successive attempts through PIL to stop alleged deportation of Rohingya Muslims.

"With Operation Sindoor still on, military gets emergency purchase powers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-operation-sindoor-still-on-military-gets-emergency-purchase-powers/articleshow/121241511.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: With India making it clear that the cessation of hostilities under Operation Sindoor is only a ‘strategic pause’ if Pakistan does not mend its ways in fuelling cross-border terrorism , govt has granted emergency procurement (EP) powers to the armed forces with an overall outer limit of around Rs 40,000 crore.The EP-6 approval for Army, IAF and Navy to further boost as well as replenish their arms stockpiles was granted by the Rajnath Singh-led Defence Acquisitions Council just a few days ago, officials told TOI on Saturday.The first four EPs were granted during the military confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh, while the fifth was for counter-terror operations. Under EP-6, the armed forces can fast-track multiple contracts, each worth Rs 300 crore, under both capital and revenue heads instead of following the normal long-winded procurement procedure.“The contracts have to be finalised within 40 days, with deliveries to be completed in one year. The powers will be exercised by the three Service vice chiefs,” an official said.This will allow the armed forces to quickly build their arsenals of missiles and other long-range weapons, loiter and precision-guided munitions, kamikaze drones and counter-drone systems, among other weapons and ammunition.There is a 15% cap each on the total capital and revenue procurements of the overall defence outlay earmarked for the ongoing fiscal. “All EP-6 purchases have to take place with the concurrence of the financial advisors, while special permission is needed for imports,” the official said. “While the actual expenditure is likely to be less than the overall 15% outer limit, it gives the Services the requisite flexibility to meet urgent operational gaps and replenish their ammunition stocks depleted in the four days of intense hostilities from May 7 to 10,” he added.IAF jets, for instance, used BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, which are jointly produced in India with Russia, the Israeli-origin air-to-ground Crystal Maze-2 and Rampage missiles and Spice- 2000 precision-guided bombs, and French-origin Scalp cruise missiles and Hammer air-to-ground precision-guided munitions, for their precision strikes, as earlier reported by TOI. IAF also used Israeli Harop and Harpy kamikaze drones.Similarly, Army units launched loitering munitions like SkyStriker as well as fired ‘smart’ extended range artillery shells like Excalibur to hammer specific targets.The armed forces also used a wide array of weapons as part of the multi-layered air defence network. They included the Barak-8 medium range surface-to-air missiles, jointly developed with Israel, and the indigenous Akash missiles.","The EP-6 approval for Army, IAF and Navy to further boost as well as replenish their arms stockpiles was granted by the Rajnath Singh-led Defence Acquisitions Council just a few days ago.

BJP: Sharif words prove Op Sindoor’s boldness

NEW DELHI: In a first formal acknowledgment, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has confirmed that the Nur Khan airbase in Rawalpindi was struck during the night of May 9–10, when India carried out missile strikes on multiple Pakistani airbases. This admission is significant as it corrects the narrative surrounding the cross-border hostilities, as previous Pakistani statements had either downplayed or denied the extent of the damage inflicted during the Indian operation.“On the night of May 9 and May 10, at around 2.30 am the Army chief called me from a secure line call that India, through its ballistic missiles had attacked us. One missile hit the Nur Khan airbase and some others have hit other areas,” Sharif said.The Pakistan PM made this statement during his speech at a ceremony titled ‘Youm-e-Tashakur’ (Thanksgiving) on what Islamabad claims is a “sham celebration” on the success of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos and Marka-e-Haq against India. During the ceremony in Islamabad, he detailed the chain of events that triggered Islamabad’s response to India. And while he summarised the events, he conceded and established the Indian claim that Nur Khan airbase was hit with Indian missile strikes .Reacting to Sharif’s admission, BJP on Saturday reasserted that it was a confirmation about scale, precision and boldness of Operation Sindoor. “Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif himself admits that General Asim Munir called him at 2.30am to inform him that India had bombed Nur Khan Air Base and several other locations. Let that sink in — the Prime Minister was woken up in the middle of the night with news of strikes deep inside Pakistan. This speaks volumes about the scale, precision, and boldness of Operation Sindoor ,” BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya said in a post on X.Sharif also added that Army Chief General Asim Munir asked for permission to respond to India will full force, which later translated into an attack by Pakistan through drones, airstrikes and missile strikes, which were successfully thwarted by Indian armed forces","Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has confirmed that the Nur Khan airbase in Rawalpindi was struck during the night of May 9–10, when India carried out missile strikes on multiple Pakistani airbases.

NEW DELHI: The Congress is once again under BJP fire. And once again, the ammunition for this all-out attack has been provided by a party leader. P Chidambaram 's reality check on the future of INDIA bloc has left the Congress scurrying for cover.""The future (of INDIA bloc) is not so bright, as Mritunjay Singh Yadav said. He seems to feel that the alliance is still intact, but I am not sure. It is only Salman (Khurshid) who can answer because he was part of the negotiating team for the INDIA bloc. If the alliance is totally intact, I will be very happy. But it shows at the seams that it is frayed,"" Chidambaram said at a book launch in the national capital on Thursday.He also hoped that the alliance can ""still be put together, there's still time"".The BJP, as expected, latched on to Chidambaram's remarks and unleashed a fierce offensive against the Congress. And why not? After all, the leadership of opposition's INDIA bloc is with the grand-old-party and Mallikarjun Kharge is its chairperson. So, Chidambaram's assessment points to failure of the Congress leadership to lead the opposition coalition effectively.Ironically, his remarks come at a time when the Congress was already struggling over statements made by Shashi Tharoor in support of PM Modi's policies during the India-Pakistan standoff. Several BJP leaders cited Tharoor's remarks praising several government's policies, including the ceasefire decision, to slam and school the Congress leadership.It was only yesterday that Congress leader Jairam Ramesh officially announced that Tharoor's remarks were his personal views. ""When Mr. Tharoor speaks, it is his view and it is not the stand of the party,"" Jairam Ramesh had said yesterday. Some reports citing Congress sources had suggested that the party had expressed displeasure with Tharoor's statements and was of the view that the Thiruvananthapuram MP had crossed the Lakshman Rekha this time around. However, Tharoor had dismissed these reports and called them ""media creation without any evidence.""Chidambaram's statement coming in this backdrop put the party once again on the backfoot.Citing Chidambaram's reality check, the BJP and its allies have been relentless in targeting the Congress and the INDIA bloc calling it a ""greed-driven coalition"", ""Maha-thagbandhan"", ""opportunistic alliance"", ""kushti-dosti model"", ""company of looters"", ""group of corrupt leaders"", ""ghamandiya alliance"". Some even raised questions on Congress's leadership role and claimed that the grand-old-party is fading and has no future.INDIA bloc, which was launched with a lot of fanfare, is actually gasping for breath today and to that extent Chidambaram is spot on in his assessment. But to announce that from a public platform definetely helps party's political rivals - the BJP in this case.It will be interesting to see how the Congress reacts to this new challenge. Party leader Udit Raj, who had slammed Tharoor for 'becoming BJP's spokesperson', had a word of advice for Chidambaram. ""Party has given him a lot. He and his son are MPs. Since the party is not in power, Chidambaram ji should go around the country and conduct a dialogue,"" he said.Tharoor has been at loggerheads with the party for some time now, but Chidambaram's remarks may have come as a surprise. Interestingly, last week when BJP national general secretary Radha Mohan Das Agrawal had slammed the Congress over demand to sack Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah for his controversial statement on Col Sofia Qureshi, he had cited both Tharoor and Chidambaram to prove his point.""If people start giving resignation for statements, then no one would be left in the Congress except for P Chidambaram and Shashi Tharoor. We should first demand Rahul Gandhi's resignation,"" the BJP general secretary had said. The fact that both these leaders have put Congress in a spot of bother may be a matter of coincidence. Perhaps.",Congress leader P Chidambaram says the future of INDIA bloc is not so bright. BJP has latched on to the remarks and unleashed a fierce offensive against the Congress. Congress was already struggling over statements made by Shashi Tharoor in support of PM Modi's policies.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121217659,imgsize-1338250,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

NEW DELHI: On the intervening night of May 9 and 10, the Indian Air Force (IAF) destroyed 11 of Pakistan's 12 airbases, retaliating against Islamabad targeting 26 locations across India as a response to the successful ""Operation Sindoor.""India's air defence systems, however, thwarted Pakistan's attacks.According to an ANI report, the subsequent counter-strikes on airbases of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) began with the Indian forces sending across ""dummy pilotless aircraft."" These were camouflaged to appear as IAF jets on enemy radars.As expected, the PAF radars and air defence network got activated to take down the Indian 'incoming aircraft.' The IAF then launched the loitering munitions, including the Israeli-made Harops, targeting Pakistan's air defence radars and command and control systems.Pakistan's air force had to mobilise its entire set of its HQ-9 air defence missile system launchers and radars to different locations; some of these were detected following activation, despite being deployed at new locations.The IAF then followed up with its long-range missiles, including the BrahMos and Scalp, using these to attack the Pakistani air bases. As per reports, around 15 BrahMos, as well as the Scalp, Rampage and Crystal Maze, were launched in the offensive.The strikes marked the first time that the BrahMos, a supersonic cruise missile system, has been used in an active conflict.The damages were so extensive that the PAF was forced to shift its aircraft to different bases in the rear. Also, it is likely to have lost a significant number of long-endurance drones and an airborne early warning and control aircraft during an IAF missile hit on a hangar at an airbase in the Sindh province.Defence sources told ANI the intensity of the strikes made Pakistan drop its plans for a counter to the capitulation of its air defence system. Islamabad urgently requested DGMO (Director General of Military Operations)-level talks to arrive at an ""understanding"" with New Delhi to put a pause to all military action going forward.The DGMO talks were held at 3:35 pm on May 10.

Espionage case: Arrested Haryana YouTuber Jyoti Malhotra linked to expelled Pakistani official - 10 points,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/espionage-case-arrested-haryana-youtuber-jyoti-malhotra-linked-to-expelled-pakistani-official-10-points/articleshow/121237184.cms,"Image credit: Jyoti Malhotra's Instagram

Here are ten key points regarding the case:



Jyoti, who runs a YouTube channel with 3,77,000 subscribers, is accused of communicating with a Pakistani employee at the Pakistan high commission in Delhi. On May 13, India expelled that Pakistani official on charges of espionage. The police said that she maintained contact with Pakistani handlers and allegedly transmitted sensitive information through messaging platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and Snapchat. She made contact with Ehsan-ur-Rahim, also known as Danish, at the Pakistan high commission in 2023 while applying for a visa to visit the neighboring country, according to the FIR. She met Danish multiple times at the Pakistan high commission in Delhi and was reportedly in contact with Pakistani intelligence operatives, the FIR said. She traveled to Pakistan twice, met Danish’s acquaintance Ali Ahwan, who arranged her stay there. Ahwan also facilitated her meetings with Pakistani security and intelligence officials, including Shakir and Rana Shahbaz. To avoid raising suspicion, Jyoti saved Shahbaz’s mobile number under the name ‘Jatt Randhawa.’ A photo posted by Jyoti Malhotra on March 22, 2025, showed her alongside two other Indian YouTubers, with a caption claiming they were at the Pakistan high commission. According to police, Jyoti admitted to sharing sensitive information with Pakistani intelligence operatives and disguising their contacts with misleading names to evade detection. Officials said that her sustained communication with these operatives constitutes a violation of the Official Secrets Act and poses a serious threat to national security. She has been charged under applicable provisions of the Official Secrets Act and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita by Civil Lines police in Hisar. She was arrested just a day after a 25-year-old postgraduate student, suspected of connections with Pakistani intelligence operatives, was taken into custody in Kaithal. Meanwhile, Nauman Ilahi, a 24-year-old from Panipat district, was also arrested on charges of allegedly providing sensitive information to contacts in Pakistan.

"What is emergency defence procurement power? India approves Rs 40,000 cr to fast-track military purchases amid Operation Sindoor",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-is-emergency-defence-procurement-power-india-approves-rs-40000-cr-to-fast-track-military-purchases-amid-operation-sindoor/articleshow/121239505.cms,"PTI file photo

What is

emergency defence procurement power

?

Emergency defence procurement power allows the armed forces to bypass standard procurement timelines for urgent military needs.

Under it, the equipment must be delivered quickly—often within 3 to 6 months.

The powers are activated during conflict, tensions, or natural disasters.

Financial limits are set for each procurement cycle, allowing the military to negotiate directly.

This mechanism was used in previous border clashes and now during Operation Sindoor.

According to ministry of defence, for items previously supplied by defence PSUs or ordnance factories, the government can issue Letters of Intent (LoI) to speed up procurement before a full contract is signed.

To ensure oversight, a high-level defence ministry committee ensures that rules are followed and no irregularities occur in large contracts.

The Indian defence forces are set to make emergency purchases worth Rs 40,000 crore to enhance combat readiness during Operation Sindoor . The defence acquisition council, chaired by senior defence and military officials, have approved the spending to ensure timely procurement of critical equipment.Key systems being prioritised under the emergency powers include surveillance drones, kamikaze drones, loitering munitions, and various types of missiles and ammunition. Some of these, like the BrahMos and Scalp cruise missiles, have already been deployed against Pakistani targets. The Rampage missile, also used in the strikes, was initially procured under similar emergency provisions.These emergency powers ensure that the equipment is received within a strict timeline, helping meet immediate operational requirements. This is the fifth such tranche of emergency procurement since 2019. Procurement teams from all three services will coordinate with defence finance advisers to manage purchases efficiently.Indian public and private defence firms, including Bharat Electronics and Solar Defence, are expected to receive orders for low-level radars and other high-tech systems. The forces also plan to acquire more Heron Mark 2 drones , which have been instrumental in surveillance during Operation Sindoor.Given the current conflict and its evolving demands, the Indian government may consider additional funds for defence needs in future budgets.","Emergency defence procurement power allows the armed forces to bypass standard procurement timelines for urgent military needs.

Indian girl visited Pakistan 🇵🇰High Commission for Iftar Dinner party🇮🇳Got invitation by embassy

Who is Jyoti Malhotra?

NEW DELHI: A video posted by now-arrested YouTuber Jyoti Malhotra - known online as Travel With Jo - has emerged as key evidence of her alleged connections with Pakistani officials.In the clip posted in March last year, filmed during an Iftar dinner at the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi, Malhotra is seen warmly praising the arrangements, expressing repeated interest in visiting Pakistan, and ""hopefully"" getting a visa.The video also captures Malhotra in conversation with Ahsan-ur-Rahim alias Danish, a Pakistan High Commission official. She appears to be well-acquainted with him, referring to previous meetings and speaking comfortably with his wife, suggesting a level of familiarity beyond casual acquaintance.According to investigators, Malhotra initially travelled to Pakistan in 2023 whilst participating in a delegation visit. During her stay, she encountered Danish. After returning to India, she maintained contact with him.Following Ahsan's recommendation, she undertook a second journey where she was introduced to Ali Ahsan, who connected her with operatives from Pakistan's intelligence services. Officials indicate that she subsequently began transmitting classified information to these contacts.Jyoti Malhotra is a 33-year-old travel content creator from Hisar, Haryana, who gained popularity through her YouTube channel Travel With Jo, which has over 377,000 subscribers. Her content typically features international travel vlogs, including several videos from Pakistan — the most recent of which was uploaded just last month. Branding herself as a cultural ambassador, Malhotra often portrayed a message of cross-border harmony in her videos.However, this public image has now come under scrutiny following her arrest on Saturday for allegedly spying for Pakistan. According to authorities, Malhotra violated the Official Secrets Act by sharing sensitive information with Pakistani intelligence handlers, posing a threat to India’s national security.She is currently in police custody as further investigations continue.","Jyoti Malhotra is a 33-year-old travel content creator from Hisar, Haryana.

Ban on Bangladesh goods likely to benefit NE

NEW DELHI: In a “retaliatory move”, govt on Saturday restricted the import of several products from Bangladesh, including a ban on the entry of readymade garments through the land route, amid growing unease with the interim administration led by chief adviser Muhammad Yunus.In a notification Saturday, the directorate general of foreign trade, however, allowed garments, the mainstay of Bangladesh industry, to be shipped via Nhava Sheva and Kolkata ports. The latest move will deal a blow to a significant chunk of the $700 million garment exports to India, a large part of which lands up in stores and on e-comm platforms.While fish, edible oil, LPG and crushed stones have been spared, import of several products via land customs stations and integrated check posts in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram and Changrabandha and Fulbari in West Bengal will be discontinued.Govt sources said the notification by DGFT was retaliatory action against Bangladesh, which last month restricted the entry of Indian yarn, the key input for making apparel, and rice. India had earlier disallowed transit of Bangladesh garments meant for export to third markets as these goods cornered the space on freighters, elbowing out India-made products.“Bangladesh cannot cherry-pick the terms of bilateral engagement solely to benefit itself or take India’s market access for granted. India is willing to discuss these issues but it is Bangladesh’s responsibility to create an environment that is free of rancour,” said an official.Govt sources said industrial growth in the northeastern states had taken a hit because of the imposition of unreasonably high and economically unviable transit charges by Dhaka, even as Bangladesh itself enjoyed free access to the entire northeastern market. Access for manufactured products, barring some farm goods, is also an issue in Bangladesh.“Due to Bangladesh’s landport restrictions, the northeastern states suffer from lack of access to the Bangladesh market to sell locally manufactured goods, restricting market access to primary agricultural goods only,” said a source, adding India’s decision on Saturday will support local manufacturing in the Northeast and India’s Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative .Earlier this week, Yunus had suggested a comprehensive economic plan for Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and the northeastern states. The notification comes days after an alleged “secret visit” by a Chinese team to Lalmonirhat to restore an air base.","India has restricted imports from Bangladesh, including a ban on readymade garments via land routes.

‘CCTV footage clearly shows how accused hit motorbike’

BENGALURU: A tiff over something as trivial as buying cigarettes triggered a road rage that led to the death of a software engineer in Bengaluru recently. One of his associates, also a techie, was injured after their bike was hit from behind by an SUV.Minutes before ramming the bike with his Creta, sales executive Prateek R (31) had been locked in heated arguments with Chetan (30) and Sanjay H N (29). Prateek had allegedly ordered the duo — total strangers — to buy him cigarettes from a pushcart as he pulled over on a road early on May 10, leading to the altercation. Both Sanjay and Chetan were injured when the SUV hit their bike, with the former succumbing to grievous head injuries May 13, three days after being hit.Prateek was arrested and booked for attempted murder initially, followed by a murder indictment after Sanjay’s death. “CCTV footage clearly shows how accused rammed into the bike,” DCP Lokesh Jagalasar said. He said the role of Prateek’s wife, who was accompanying him at that time, was also under the lens.Around 4am on May 10, Sanjay and Chetan were smoking and having tea at a roadside pushcart on Vasantapura Main Road when a Creta pulled up near the duo. Prateek shouted: “Get me four-five cigarettes.” Chetan told Prateek to get off and get the cigarettes himself. “Irked, he got off, abused us, and was about to hit me when Sanjay intervened & pushed him away,” Chetan said in his statement to the police.As Sanjay and Chetan hit the road, the SUV came charging from behind and rammed into their bike. Sanjay was shifted to two hospitals before he died, Chetan said.","Software engineer Sanjay H N died after his bike was hit from behind by an SUV.

Sparing before show of unity

For Congress, Tharoor is a nettlesome problem

Tewari’s name in outreach teams list could also be a challenge for Congress

NEW DELHI: On the day the Centre formally announced the composition of seven delegations of MPs to be sent to various countries to articulate India’s stance against terrorism and highlight ‘Operation Sindoor’, a row erupted Saturday over govt ignoring Congress ’s recommendations on who should be included from its ranks and, instead, choosing Shashi Tharoor — whom the party did not name — to head one of the delegations.Angry at the Centre naming Tharoor and not including three of four MPs it had recommended — Gaurav Gogoi, Syed Naseer Hussain and Raja Warring — Congress slammed the Modi govt for playing games” on a sensitive issue, and urged it not to politicise the delegations. From Congress’s list, only Anand Sharma has been picked.Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said party MPs included “at the instance of the Modi govt will, of course, go with the delegations and make their contributions”. He added, “INC will...not play partisan politics on national security issues, like BJP does.”Having been shocked by the Left the last time when Pinarayi Vijayan returned to office defying the state’s tradition of ejecting incumbent govts, Congress this time would like to consolidate its leaders to be able to put up a serious challenge as the leading opposition. Support for Shashi Tharoor among some UDF allies may also deter Congress.Recent events have been marked by a growing gulf between the restive MP and Congress, and the fresh confrontation could be the point where the party and Tharoor may have to take a call on their relationship — either Congress swallows its pride and accommodates its star MP or the latter chooses to break free. In between, there exists possibility of Tharoor being an isolated member within the party: something that the Thiruvananthapuram MP must have factored in before he justified his praise for ‘Operation Sindoor’ by saying it was patriotic thing to do.On Saturday, no sooner had govt released names of seven MPs leading global outreach on ‘Operation Sindoor’, which included Tharoor, than Congress released its list of four nominees submitted to the govt for the delegations that did not include Tharoor. The Thiruvananthapuram MP, however, went ahead by announcing that he was honoured to be leading the delegation, and that he would “not be found wanting” when summoned in national interest. Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh addressed the development with a jibe, “there is a difference in being in Congress and being of Congress”.It is ironic that the rumblings came barely a month after Tharoor took the central stage at the AICC session in Ahmedabad, where he was the first speaker on the political resolution introduced by Sachin Pilot . But some felt it was not so ironic after all because Tharoor in his brief speech had urged the party to be one of positivity and hope, and of solutions and not just counting problems, in what could be viewed as an advice to be prudent in picking battles against PM Narendra Modi and his party, BJP.If it comes to a breaking point after Tharoor having called his support for the govt decision over the party’s as “national interest”, Congress would be aware that BJP would use it to paint the arch rival in a negative light. Clearly, Congress has a nettlesome problem on its hands.After Shashi Tharoor, Congress may face more challenge if Chandigarh MP Manish Tewari is included in the all-party delegations that are to visit some foreign countries as part of govt’s global outreach on Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Sources close to Tewari said, “If the MP’s name is included in the all-party delegations, he will surely rise to the occasion to serve his nation and go with the delegation.”Meanwhile, former Union minister Anand Sharma has received a call from govt that he would be in the delegation. He is one of the four names recommended by Congress. Sharma said, “I received a call from minister (Kiren) Rijiju and I have accepted it as the nominee of Congress.”It is learnt that former minister Salman Khurshid is likely to back out if he figures in the final list. The fourth Congress leader that govt contacted, Punjab MP Amar Singh, may also skip. Neither of the four from Congress that govt contacted are in the shortlist that Rahul Gandhi has submitted to Union minister Kiren Rijiju.","For Congress, Tharoor is a nettlesome problem.

Pak thought it would threaten us with atom bombs, & we would be scared. But our armed forces gave them a befitting reply. Our three armed forces responded to bricks with stones,” Shah, who is on a two-day visit to Gujarat, said in Gandhinagar district’s Kolavada village.Shah said our armed forces eliminated nearly 100 terrorists, destroyed the headquarters of terror outfits, and also destroyed 15 military air bases, which eventually reduced the Pakistan air force’s ability to hit back. He said PM Narendra Modi himself gave the name ‘ Operation Sindoor ’ in honour of the country’s women.He said that before Modi became PM, terrorist attacks used to take place at regular intervals for years. “Terrorists backed by Pakistan routinely killed our soldiers, bombed our cities, and plotted with impunity. No strong response was ever given,” Shah said.“During the tenure of PM Modi, India saw 3 terror attacks backed by Pak — Uri, Pulwama, and Pahalgam. In all three instances, India gave a befitting reply. After Uri, we carried out a surgical strike , after Pulwama, we warned them with an air strike, and after Pahalgam, the terror headquarters were razed to the ground,” said Shah. As per Shah, Army also destroyed 9 camps which were used to train terrorists and to send them into India.","Shah said our armed forces eliminated nearly 100 terrorists, destroyed the headquarters of terror outfits, and also destroyed 15 military air bases.

Gujarat minister’s son held for ties to company that swindled Rs 71 crore MGNREGS funds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/guj-ministers-son-held-for-ties-to-company-that-swindled-rs-71-crore-mgnregs-funds/articleshow/121241593.cms,"Guj panchayat minister’s son held

VADODARA: Police in Gujarat Saturday arrested the elder son of minister of state for panchayats Bachu Khabad in connection with an alleged Rs 71 crore scam tied to MGNREGS in Dahod district. Balwant Khabad was taken into custody near Bathwada toll plaza after weeks of evading arrest.Police alleged that he was linked to Shri Raj Construction Co, which received payments for supplying materials for Nrega projects despite not qualifying through bidding. His younger brother Kiran Khabad, connected to Shri Raj Traders, remains at large. Both firms received funds without securing contracts, police added.The scam, unearthed in April by Dahod’s district rural development authority (DRDA), involved 32 firms supplying materials in Devgadh Baria and Dhanpur talukas. None had emerged as lowest bidders, a requirement under procurement rules. DRDA’s inquiry revealed several projects were either never initiated or inflated, yet payments were cleared.Khabad, an OBC heavyweight of BJP and a four-term MLA, has not responded publicly to his son’s arrest. Balwant and Kiran had filed anticipatory bail applications in Dahod court but later withdrew them.Balwant and co-accused Darshit Patel, a taluka development officer currently posted in Kheda, were produced in Dahod court and remanded in police custody for five days. Patel was earlier posted in Devgadh Baria, one of the talukas named in the investigation.Seven people have been arrested so far in the scam, which came to light following multiple representations to DRDA, including Congress legislators. Leader of opposition Amit Chavda, of Congress, demanded formation of an SIT, alleging: “This scam could be much larger. Only an honest investigation can uncover full details.”","Balwant Khabad was taken into custody near Bathwada toll plaza after weeks of evading arrest.

"At 1.5 lakh, pedestrians made up 20% of road deaths in 5 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/at-1-5-lakh-pedestrians-made-up-20-of-road-deaths-in-5-years/articleshow/121241568.cms,"Nearly 1.5 lakh pedestrians died in India from 2019-2023, highlighting their vulnerability despite having right-of-way. A Supreme Court panel audit revealed that footpath availability varies widely across states, often not meeting standards. The court emphasized pedestrians' rights under Article 21, advocating for accessible, encroachment-free footpaths as a crucial, low-cost safety measure.

Just 3% of J&K roads have pavements

NEW DELHI: Despite having the first right on roads, pedestrians remain the most vulnerable user and data show that nearly 1.5 lakh of them died in road crashes in the country in from 2019-2023 out of the little over 7.9 lakh of all road fatalities during these years.While Supreme Court this week said that “rights of pedestrians to use footpaths are guaranteed under Article 21 of Constitution”, audits carried out in 24 states following a direction of an SC panel found that roads having footpaths across most states and UTs range between 19% and 73%, with Maharashtra having the maximum.Details of the audit findings were released recently by the Transportation Research and Injury Prevention Centre of Injury and IIT-Delhi in its report ‘India Status Report on Road Safety’. The availability of footpaths and whether these comply with the norms of width and height specified by the Indian Road Congress (IRC) were arrived at based on surveys across four cities in each state.As per the findings, in Jammu & Kashmir, barely 3% of the roads surveyed had footpath, and in the case of Puducherry, it was only 5%. In Bihar and Haryana, 19%-20% of roads had footpath. In most cases, footpath were not as per IRC norms.The apex court, in its order this week, observed, “It is necessary to have proper footpaths for citizens. They should be such that they should be accessible for persons with disabilities and removal of encroachments is mandatory. This court has recognised that the right of pedestrians to use footpaths is guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.”Amar Srivastava, who heads India Road Safety Campaign, a youth-led road safety movement, said that building proper footpaths and keeping them free for pedestrians is the most low cost intervention to prevent road crashes. “So, this should be the priority of every city administration and local govts,” he added.According to World Health Organisation, globally pedestrians make up 21% of road fatalities and in India, nearly one-fifth of people killed in road crashes in 2023 were walkers. WHO, last week, released a toolkit for promoting ‘walking and cycling’ for govt bodies as part of the ongoing UN Road Safety Week with the theme ‘make walking and cycling safe’, laying out why promoting walking and cycling should be the priority of govts for sustainable development and good health of people.","Nearly 1.5 lakh pedestrians died in India from 2019-2023, highlighting their vulnerability despite having right-of-way.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Friday said right to live in a pollution free atmosphere was a part of the fundamental right as it struck down Centre’s office memorandum allowing ex post facto or retrospective environmental clearances to projects in violation of norms.A bench comprising Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan made scathing remarks in its judgement delivered on a plea filed by Vanashakti organisation and said, “Union govt, as much as individual citizens, has a constitutional obligation to protect the environment.”The court said it “must come down very heavily” on Centre’s attempt to do “something which is completely prohibited under the law”. It added, “Cleverly, the words ex post facto have not been used, but without using those words, there is a provision to effectively grant ex post facto EC. The 2021 OM has been issued in violation of the decisions of this court….”The bench, therefore, declared the 2021 office memorandum (OM) and related circulars “arbitrary, illegal, and contrary to Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006”.

The increase to 4,000 reflects the growing spirit of service among veterans and trust reposed in them by the govt and local populace.","4,000 ex-servicemen volunteers have been identified for the initiative.

NEW DELHI: MEA has strongly refuted Rahul Gandhi’s allegation that external affairs minister S Jaishankar had “informed” Pakistan about targeting its terror infrastructure as part of Operation Sindoor, calling the Congress neta’s charge “utter misrepresentation of facts”.“We had warned Pakistan at the start — which was clearly during the early phase after Operation Sindoor’s commencement. This is being falsely represented as having occurred before the operation began. This utter misrepresentation of facts is being called out,” the MEA spokesperson said in reference to Indian Army’s communication to their Pakistani counterparts after the successful strikes on terror hubs deep inside Pakistan.Press Information Bureau’s Fact Check Unit too asserted that the EAM’s remarks were being misrepresented. It said the video circulating on social media had been selectively edited to mislead viewers.Rahul, on X, accused the Modi govt of compromising national security by allegedly notifying Pakistan ahead of Operation Sindoor. Sharing a video of Jaishankar, he wrote: “Informing Pakistan at the start of our attack was a crime. EAM has publicly admitted that GOI did it. Who authorised it? How many aircraft did our air force lose as a result?”The video features Jaishankar stating, “At the start of the operation, we had sent a message to Pakistan, saying, ‘We are striking at terrorist infrastructure and we are not striking at the military.’ So the military has the option of standing out and not interfering in this process. They chose not to take that good advice.”Rahul’s criticism sparked swift rebuttal from the govt. The PIB Fact Check Unit dismissed the interpretation of the minister’s words as “false and fabricated”. It posted on X: “Social media posts quoting EAM @DrSJaishankar are implying that India gave advance information to Pakistan about #OperationSindoor. This is false and fabricated.” The agency further urged users to avoid sharing unverified content during sensitive national security operations.PIB officials clarified that the EAM’s remarks were part of a tactical communication issued during the operation, aimed at emphasising that the Indian Army had targeted only terror infrastructure and deliberately spared Pakistani military assets, which would remain unharmed if Pakistan army chose not to escalate.","MEA has strongly refuted Rahul Gandhi’s allegation that external affairs minister S Jaishankar had “informed” Pakistan about targeting its terror infrastructure as part of Operation Sindoor. “We had warned Pakistan at the start — which was clearly during the early phase after Operation.

India gives special entry to 160 Afghan trucks via Attari,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-gives-special-entry-to-160-afghan-trucks-via-attari/articleshow/121221556.cms,"Afghan trucks allowed to unload goods at Attari

Poll Should countries increase trade and humanitarian aid to help rebuild nations facing conflict and crises? No, it may create more challenges Yes, it promotes peace and development

NEW DELHI: India is learnt to have approved as a “special gesture” entry of 160 Afghan trucks carrying dry fruits and nuts through the Attari border with Pakistan, as bilateral ties with the Taliban develop rapidly even in the absence of a formal recognition for the regime in Kabul. According to sources, Pakistan held up clearance for a while on the Wagah side for the movement of the trucks before allowing some of them to unload at Attari on Friday.India had decided to shut the Attari-Wagah border on April 23, following the Pahalgam terrorist attack that took place a day earlier. Pakistan has in the past allowed one-way trade between Afghanistan and India through that border, facilitating export of Afghan goods to India but not any reverse export from India to Afghanistan.Expanding trade ties was one of the issues that external affairs minister S Jaishankar discussed with the Afghan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in what was the first political engagement between India and the Taliban on May 15. Despite the hurdles created by transit issues in Pakistan, India remains the largest market for Afghan products in South Asia and annual trade stands at approximately $ 1 billion.The one time in the recent past Pakistan did allow India to send goods to Afghanistan through the land border was in late 2021, after India proposed sending 50,000 tonnes of wheat as aid to the drought-affected country. The Taliban, who had just returned to Kabul, pushed Pakistan to not hold up clearance for the supply.Muttaqi had called Jaishankar on Thursday ahead of his upcoming visit to Iran and China, a fact India attaches a lot of significance to. Both leaders had agreed to remain in touch and Jaishankar thanked Muttaqi for the solidarity Kabul expressed for India after the Pahalgam attack and for not buying into subsequent attempts by Pakistan authorities to sow discord between India and the Taliban, including through the claim that India fired missiles at Afghanistan. A source said this was significant “posturing” given the tense situation that followed India’s Operation Sindoor.Since foreign secretary Vikram Misri met Muttaqi in Dubai earlier this year, India has been looking to resume work on its projects in Afghanistan and, while also considering more development cooperation projects for the people of Afghanistan. These efforts will likely be further expedited by India’s move to politically engage Kabul.“We are also considering humanitarian assistance for the Afghan refugees expelled by Pakistan,’’ said a source, speaking on condition of anonymity. Formal recognition, however, will have to wait until the international community remains convinced that the Taliban dispensation is not serious about providing inclusive governance and removing restrictions on women.“Since 2021, India has sent 50,000 tonnes of wheat, 350 tonnes of medicines, 40,000 litres of Malathion and 28 tonnes of earthquake relief material to Afghanistan. We have also provided 2000 online scholarships for Afghan students. This aid was appreciated by the Afghan side,’’ added the source.",India is learnt to have approved entry of 160 Afghan trucks carrying dry fruits and nuts.
