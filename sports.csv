IPL 2025: The unsung heroes of India's T20 league

Foreign players happy with GT ‘communication’

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years

Break gives Capitals a breather

NEW DELHI: Shubman Gill ’s cheerful demeanour can be infectious. Before a drizzle interrupted training at the Ferozeshah Kotla on Saturday evening, Gill gathered his Gujarat Titans teammates and indulged in a fun warm-up session of football on the eve of their match against Delhi Capitals . His shrill voice and teenage levels of enthusiasm aside, it was apparent this was an emerging leader who exercised authority over the younger batch of players.Gill, at just 25, is at a defining stage of his career. The buzz in Indian cricket suggests he is seen as a long-term captaincy option and the promotion may happen as soon as next month, in the five-Test series in England. That he has come to Delhi with a team that has one foot in the IPL playoffs is a good point of reference to assess his leadership qualities.“He’s been fantastic with the way he’s been around with the group. I don’t need to mention how well he is batting right now and the way he is handling the situation. He has been scoring a lot of runs and managing the team really well,” Titans assistant coach Parthiv Patel said on Saturday.“He’s been very proactive on the field and off it. In fact, he plays an important role off the field. He spends a lot of time with the young players. I’ve said this before too. You can see actually Shubman Gill the captain in the dressing room. That’s what you want in a leader,” Patel said before adding. “Going forward, I can’t comment on whatever the talks (in the India camp) are, but Shubman Gill as Gujarat Titans captain has been fantastic.”Besides the captaincy talk, Gill the batter has been impeccable in white-ball cricket over the last three months. The rich vein of form notwithstanding, Gill barely misses a training session. On Saturday evening, he went through a long and rigorous nets session even as Delhi Capitals kept switching batters in the adjacent nets. There were no funky shots. He presented the full face of the bat to every ball and concentrated on timing, looking to hit mostly down the ground. He seemed in absolute control.Patel also said the GT management didn’t have any problems getting all their overseas players back, since the there was clear communication with the players.“I can tell you that the players were very happy with the way we dealt with the situation. We have been very transparent and they were happy with the way we communicated the situation with them. That’s why all of them are back,” Patel said.While Titans will look to seal their playoff spot on Sunday, Capitals will look to resurrect their campaign after it hit free fall before the tournament was halted last week. Capitals allrounder Vipraj Nigam said the team was looking at a fresh start. “We started the tournament well. When we reassembled, we decided we will treat this game as we did back when we started the tournament,” Vipraj said.","Shubman Gill is at a defining stage of his career.

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals are gearing up to take on Gujarat Titans in their IPL 2025 clash at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi, and all eyes will be on star wicketkeeper-batter KL Rahul , who stands on the brink of a historic milestone. As reported by TimesofIndia.com , Delhi Capitals are considering a tweak in their batting order for the final three league-stage matches, with the experienced KL Rahul likely to return to the top as an opener for the Axar Patel-led side.Currently placed fifth on the points table with 13 points from 11 matches, DC are keen to solidify their top order, and promoting KL Rahul is being viewed as a key strategic move.KL Rahul is just 33 runs away from breaking an elite record held by batting legend Virat Kohli . If he manages to score those runs against Gujarat Titans on Sunday, he will become the fastest Indian to reach 8000 T20 runs, achieving the feat in just his 214th innings—surpassing Kohli’s record of 243 innings.The milestone will also make him the second-fastest overall in T20 history, ahead of Pakistan’s Babar Azam, who reached the mark in 218 innings.So far this season, KL Rahul has opened just once, batted at No.3 twice, and featured at No.4 in seven games—a role assigned to him before the season began.While he has produced steady performances in the middle order, the DC think tank is now inclined to use his experience at the top during the powerplay overs.However, Gujarat Titans could look to crash KL Rahul’s party by unleashing their ace spinner Rashid Khan.The Afghan star has had the better of KL Rahul in T20 battles so far—conceding just 40 runs off 47 balls while dismissing him three times.With a playoff spot at stake and a historic record within reach, Sunday’s clash promises high stakes for both KL Rahul and the Capitals.","KL Rahul is just 33 runs away from breaking an elite record held by batting legend Virat Kohli.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on how IPL gave him a lifeline & his tribute to Phil Hughes

NEW DELHI: Nothing seems to be going right for Chennai Super Kings over the past two seasons. The five-time IPL champions missed out on a playoff spot in 2024 and endured another disappointing campaign in IPL 2025 . They were, in fact, the first team to be knocked out of the playoff race this season. Former CSK player Robin Uthappa acknowledged the team’s underwhelming performances but didn’t hold back in criticising fans who took their mockery of the MS Dhoni-led side to extreme levels.Matches between CSK and RCB have always been high-voltage affairs, often bringing out the worst in fans on both sides. The marquee clash has repeatedly seen heated exchanges in the stands, with supporters hurling offensive jibes at each other.This season too, before the IPL was suspended, RCB edged out CSK in a thrilling encounter to keep their playoff hopes alive.Ahead of that game, some RCB fans were spotted selling ‘CSK jail’ jerseys—an attempt to taunt the Chennai-based franchise over their two-year suspension from the IPL in 2016 and 2017.However, Uthappa, who has donned the jersey of both franchises during his IPL career, was unimpressed with the gesture. He criticised the actions of some RCB fans who held up white T-shirts with black stripes to mock CSK supporters.""It was pretty intense. Outside the stadium, they were mocking the team, the players of the team when the bus was leaving, that was one thing that I saw, which I thought was in bad taste. The other one that I saw were the fans fighting with each other. I saw women being heckled, which felt unsavory, to be very honest. We saw that even in Chennai last year, again, uncalled for. It's not on whatsoever,"" said Uthappa on his YouTube channel.""It has gotten pretty intense. They are holding up jerseys, white T-shirts marked with black lines, stating the two years that CSK were banned for. They have kind of written MS' number on it, and Thala under it, depicting that they were in jail for two years, or whatever. It's getting a little beyond sport which concerns me. Because at the end of the day, this is a sport,"" he added.RCB took a significant step towards securing an IPL playoff spot, while defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) were eliminated from contention after persistent rain washed out their clash on Saturday, forcing both teams to share points.With 17 points from 12 matches, RCB now sit atop the points table, ahead of second-placed Gujarat Titans (16 points). A win in either of their remaining two fixtures will be enough to confirm their place in the playoffs.RCB are set to host the already-eliminated Sunrisers Hyderabad on May 23, followed by an away game against Lucknow Super Giants on May 27.",Chennai Super Kings were knocked out of the IPL playoff race this season.

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years

NEW DELHI: In the history of Indian sports, only one sportsperson has been honoured with the Bharat Ratna — and that is Sachin Tendulkar . The legendary batter was recommended for the award by the central government in February 2014, and then-President Pranab Mukherjee conferred the honour upon him. No athlete before or since has received this prestigious civilian award.However, former India cricketer Suresh Raina has now called for Virat Kohli to be conferred with the Bharat Ratna, recognising his immense contributions to Indian cricket.""Virat Kohli ne jitni upalabdhiyan haasil ki hain, Bharat aur Bharatiya cricket ke liye unhone jo bhi kiya hai, uske liye unhein Bharat Ratna se sammaanit kiya jana chahiye. Bharat sarkar ko unhein Bharat Ratna award dena chahiye [The number of achievements Virat Kohli has accomplished, and whatever he has done for India and Indian cricket, for that he should be honoured with the Bharat Ratna. The Government of India should give him the Bharat Ratna award],"" Raina said during a show on Star Sports.Kohli recently announced his retirement from Test cricket, putting an end to the speculation around his future in the longest format.The 36-year-old featured in 123 Test matches for India, scoring 9230 runs, including 30 centuries, at an average of 46.85. He will now only play in ODIs, having stepped away from T20 Internationals last year.""As I step away from this format, it's not easy - but it feels right. I've given it everything I had, and it's given me back so much more than I could've hoped for,"" Kohli shared on his Instagram page.""I'm walking away with a heart full of gratitude - for the game, for the people I shared the field with, and for every single person who made me feel seen along the way,"" he added.His exit marks another major retirement in Indian Test cricket, following Ravichandran Ashwin (in December) and Rohit Sharma (last week), who also bid farewell to the format.","Suresh Raina calls for Virat Kohli to be honoured with the Bharat Ratna.

NEW DELHI: MS Dhoni is more than just a cricketer—he is an emotion for millions of fans across India, particularly in Chennai. Revered as Thala by Chennai Super Kings (CSK) supporters, Dhoni commands an enormous fan following. Whenever he walks out to bat, the crowd erupts in thunderous applause, and the sea of yellow in the stands becomes a spectacle. The sound decibel often shoots up as fans lose control just to catch a glimpse of their beloved Thala.Whether CSK are playing at home in Chennai or away, Dhoni’s presence alone guarantees full stadiums and electrifying atmospheres.

NEW DELHI: Rain played spoilsport on Saturday, halting the much-anticipated restart of the Indian Premier League 2025. The high-profile clash between Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) at Bengaluru’s M. Chinnaswamy Stadium was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to persistent rain The washout delivered a fatal blow to KKR’s playoff hopes. With only 12 points from 13 games and just one match left, the two-time champions were officially eliminated from contention. They now join Chennai Super Kings, Rajasthan Royals, and Sunrisers Hyderabad on the list of teams knocked out of the playoff race.RCB, on the other hand, benefitted from the shared points. With the one point earned, they climbed to the top of the 10-team table with 17 points from 12 games — virtually securing a spot in the playoffs. A loss for either Punjab Kings or Delhi Capitals on Sunday would seal RCB’s qualification.The atmosphere in Bengaluru, however, was one of disappointment, especially for fans who had gathered in large numbers to pay tribute to Virat Kohli following his recent Test retirement. Many turned up in white jerseys bearing Kohli’s iconic No. 18, hoping to catch a glimpse of the star batter.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on how IPL gave him a lifeline & his tribute to Phil Hughes

Delhi Capitals (DC) and Gujarat Titans (GT) will reconvene at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi on Sunday (May 18) with the objective of picking up where they left off when the IPL came to an abrupt halt. That would apply more to GT than the hosts DC with the Shubman Gill-led franchise top of the standings on 16 points. A win would confirm their spot in the playoffs and condemn DC to their third loss in four matches with no result in between.For all that to happen, though, the rain has to stay clear, which has been a daily occurrence over the past few days. Things do not look promising for Sunday either with bouts of rain expected to curtail the contest.If it is indeed a stop-start contest, it would go in perfect harmony with the IPL this time around. On May 8, the T20 league was halted, practically in the middle of a match (Punjab Kings vs Delhi Capitals in Dharamsala) only to be suspended for a week.Following the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, IPL resumes tonight. Things have changed in the aftermath, though. Players have had to pause and resume and quite a few overseas players have not returned.""We are in a situation right now where we would have liked to play games, we had the momentum. But the situation was such that you can't do anything about it. You have to just accept it and move on from there,"" said Gujarat Titans assistant coach Parthiv Patel on Saturday.""We feel that these are the things which are not in your control. So, you don't want to think about it. At the moment, we are playing good cricket and we want to carry on with that,"" he added.Gujarat Titans, primed to reach the playoffs, are due to be hit significantly by the rescheduled IPL. Jos Buttler and Kagiso Rabada will now be available only till the end of the league stage. Kusal Mendis will replace Buttler from the playoffs.""We all have to accept it and find a way out of it. I can't speak for any other team, which players they are losing or how they are going to cope up with it.""We are not losing too many players. But we are quite okay with whatever the situation is. And we are quite confident that the players who will come in will step up and perform for us,"" said Patel on the overseas players challenge.For DC, who were at the heart of the kerfuffle in Dharamsala, the pause possibly came at a good time. They lost to Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Kolkata Knight Riders and then had a washed out contest with Sunrisers Hyderabad. At the Arun Jaitley Stadium the Axar Patel-led franchise has mustered just one win, in a Super Over, while going down thrice.""This is our home ground. Unfortunately we have lost a couple of matches here but it is a fresh start. We have had a few days off since the IPL was rescheduled. We will pick up the way we started the campaign,"" said Vipraj Nigam.After a cracking start, they have been subdued ever since the loss to MI and are due to bring in a change at the top with KL Rahul expected to open the innings. With 13 points and standing at fifth place, playoffs are still within reach.DC, compared to GT, are more affected by the absence of certain overseas players due to the rescheduling. Mitchell Starc, Jake Fraser-McGurk and Donovan Ferreira will not be available. Mustafizur Rahman has been brought in as the replacement for Fraser-McGurk but only for May 18-24. Tristan Stubbs, meanwhile, is available only until the league stage.""It is very tough to replace someone like Mitchell Starc. We have made one or two team changes, so basically this is like a start to the season. We will try to not feel the impact of those who are not with the squad anymore. We will try as a team with whatever players we have available,"" stated Nigam.The 20-year-old spinner acknowledged the efforts of the Indian Army, the government and the franchise to help get the squad back home amid the pause when things were challenging throughout.

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years

Could Indian cricket legend Virat Kohli return to red-ball cricket in England despite recently announcing his retirement from Test matches? Middlesex certainly hope so. According to a report in The Guardian, the London-based county side is eager to bring Kohli on board for a potential first-class or one-day stint at the iconic Lord’s Cricket Ground .Alan Coleman, Middlesex’s director of cricket, confirmed their interest: “Virat Kohli is the most iconic player of his generation, so of course we are interested in having that conversation.”While Kohli has retired from Test cricket, he has not ruled out playing first-class matches — leaving the door open for a County Championship or One-Day Cup appearance.Middlesex have a track record of attracting global stars, including AB de Villiers in 2019 and Kane Williamson this season. They also benefit from a strong relationship with the MCC, who have reportedly offered to share the cost of bringing Kohli in — a move that helped seal previous marquee signings.The hope is to tempt Kohli with the allure of playing at Lord’s, often referred to as the “home of cricket.” Middlesex return to the venue in September for key Division Two fixtures, including one against Lancashire — potentially setting up a final on-field duel between Kohli and English pace legend James Anderson .Kohli, who owns a home in London, had once signed with Surrey in 2018 before a neck injury scuppered the opportunity. Still, he had a stellar England tour that year.While Kohli remains unavailable for foreign T20 leagues due to his BCCI contract, his fans might yet see him don the whites at a county ground — possibly even alongside Kane Williamson in the Middlesex middle order.",Virat Kohli has retired from Test cricket after 14 years in the game.

NEW DELHI: It was a ""bitter-sweet"" outing for Neeraj Chopra at the Doha Diamond League , where he finally breached the elusive 90m mark but still had to settle for second place. The 27-year-old Indian javelin star, who has battled a persistent groin injury in recent years, looked back in top shape as he hurled the spear to a career-best 90.23m in his third attempt. With that, Chopra became the third Asian and 25th athlete overall to achieve a 90m-plus throw — a prestigious club led by his current coach, Czech legend Jan Zelezny.However, Germany’s Julian Weber had the final say in Doha. He snatched victory with a last-gasp effort of 91.06m, surpassing Chopra’s mark and pushing the Indian Olympic gold medallist to second spot, despite leading until the final round.Having finally crossed the 90m threshold — a mark he had been chasing for five years — Chopra said there’s more to come, especially now that he’s feeling close to fully fit. The focus now shifts to refining his technique with coach Zelezny, under whose guidance Chopra has been training since February, although the partnership officially began in November.""I am very happy with the 90m mark but it's a little bit of a bitter-sweet experience actually. But never mind, I and my coach are still working on some aspects of my throw. We started working together only in February this year. I am still learning things,"" Chopra said after the competition.""I was always feeling something in my groin in the last few years. I did not give my best because of that. This year I feel much better, we will also work on some aspects and so I believe I can throw more than 90m in the upcoming events this year till the World Championships.""The World Championships are scheduled to take place in Tokyo from September 13 to 21.Asked about his next target now that the 90m mark has been ticked off, Chopra said, ""My next goal is just 90m. I believe I am ready to throw farther. It's just the beginning of a long season.""I am very happy that Jan Zelezny is my coach and we worked very hard in South Africa. We are still working on some aspects.""Chopra credited the favourable conditions in Doha for helping him unleash the big throw and shared that Zelezny had predicted a 90m effort even before the competition.""When I was having warm-up throws my coach said today is the day when I can throw 90m. After my 90m throw also, he told me I can throw 2-3m farther.""The wind helps for sure and the weather is a little warm and that helps. It's the first competition of the year, so everyone came with a fresh mindset after a long time and has hunger inside for the throwing part.""I also told Julian (Weber) that we can throw 90m. I am also happy for him. We have tried very hard for 90m for so many years, and so we are happy. It's like a good push between us and in the next competition we will push each other again and will throw farther,"" he added.This wasn't the first time Chopra had finished runner-up after a record throw.""It had happened earlier also. When I threw an NR with over 89m in Turku, I finished second. In Stockholm DL, when I threw 89.94m, I was second again, so also here,"" he said.Meanwhile, Weber, who also breached the 90m mark for the first time, expressed joy over the competition and Chopra’s breakthrough.""I did not know how it happened. I had a very good massage thanks to my physiotherapist. It was fun today. Neeraj threw his first 90m plus and I went past the mark in my last throw and that was just perfect.""I was very happy for him. We have been fighting for the 90m throw for a long time and we both achieved that today. So, it was very special for us.""Weber’s 91.06m effort — the best in the world this season so far — made him the 26th athlete to breach the coveted distance.Two-time world champion and Paris Olympics bronze medallist Anderson Peters of Grenada finished third with a best of 84.65m, registered on his opening attempt.",Neeraj Chopra threw a career-best 90.23m at the Doha Diamond League.

Kohli, who called time on his Test career on Monday, finished with 123 matches, 9,230 runs at an average of 46.85, including 30 centuries — a glittering resume by any standard.Shastri revealed that he had spoken to Kohli just a week before the announcement and sensed that the decision had already been made.""I did speak to him about it, I think a week before that [his announcement] and his mind was very clear that he'd given us everything. There were no regrets,"" Shastri told The ICC Review.""Virat surprised me because I thought he had at least two-three years of Test match cricket left in him. But then, when you're mentally fried and overcooked, that's what tells your body. You might be physically the fittest guy in the business.""You might be fitter than half the guys in your team, but mentally you're well done, as they say, then it sends a message to the body. You know, that's it,"" he said.Shastri also elaborated on the intense spotlight Kohli operated under and how that played a part in his burnout.""He's got accolades around the globe. He has a bigger following than any other cricketer in the last decade. Whether it's Australia, whether it's South Africa, he just got people to watch the game. There was a love-hate relationship.""They would get angry because he had the ability to get under the skin of the viewers. In the way he celebrated, you know his intensity was such that it was like a rash.""It spread very quickly, not just within the dressing room, but within living rooms as well for people watching cricket. So, he was an infectious personality,"" Shastri added.Kohli captained India to 40 victories in 68 Tests, making him the most successful Indian captain in the format.""If he decided to do something, then he gave his 100%, which is not easy to match. Individually, as a bowler, as a batsman,"" said Shastri, who shared a successful captain-coach partnership with Kohli.""A player does his job, [and] then you sit back. But [with Kohli] when the team goes out, it's as if he has to take all the wickets, he has to take all the catches, he has to make all the decisions on the field.""That much involvement, I would think there's going to be a burnout somewhere if he doesn't take a rest, if he doesn't compartmentalise how much he wants to play across formats, there is bound to be a burnout.""Together, the Kohli-Shastri duo delivered one of Indian cricket's most successful Test phases — from a maiden series win in Australia to back-to-back wins in the West Indies and ending a two-decade-long drought in Sri Lanka.According to Shastri, there is nothing left for Kohli to prove in the game.""At times when you quit the game, you know, and after a month or two months you say, 'I wish I had done this, I wish I had done this,"" he said.""[Kohli] He's done everything. He's captained sides, he's won World Cups, he's won an Under-19 World Cup [2008] himself. I mean, there's nothing for him to achieve,"" he said.","Virat Kohli retired from Test cricket after 14 years on Monday. Kohli captained India to 40 victories in 68 Tests, making him the most successful Indian captain in the format. Former India head coach Ravi Shastri says there is nothing left for Kohli to prove in the game.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121202776,imgsize-119966,width-400,resizemode-4/Virat2-1605-ICC.jpg"

Shaken by the mid-season suspension of the IPL, Delhi Capitals (DC) will look to revive their playoff hopes as they face table-toppers Gujarat Titans (GT) in a crucial reverse fixture.DC have struggled recently, managing only one win in their last five matches, and sit just outside the top four with 13 points from 11 games. Their troubles deepened with Mitchell Starc opting out of the remainder of the season, leaving a weakened pace attack. However, the arrival of Mustafizur Rahman offers some relief as he is expected to lead the bowling against GT's in-form top order.DC's batting has also been inconsistent, with the top order failing to fire in key matches. The return of Faf du Plessis is a welcome boost, and along with KL Rahul and captain Axar Patel, DC will aim to set a solid platform.GT, meanwhile, have been dominant, led by the batting trio of Jos Buttler, Shubman Gill and B Sai Sudharsan, all of whom have crossed 500 runs. Their bowling attack, featuring Prasidh Krishna, Mohammed Siraj, and R Sai Kishore, has been equally potent.DC will need early breakthroughs to challenge GT and stay alive in the playoff race.The conditions at the Arun Jaitley Stadium are decent, though the weather is heating up. The pitch has a compact structure with a slight sheen, suggesting it will offer consistent bounce and hold up well throughout the match. The ground is small — 63 and 62 meters square, 67 straight — making boundary hitting easier. The well-maintained outfield should aid quick scoring. It’s not a batting paradise, but a competitive pitch where a first-innings total between 165 and 190 is very achievable.Faf du Plessis, Abishek Porel (wk), KL Rahul, Sameer Rizvi , Axar Patel (c), Tristan Stubbs, Madhav Tiwari, Mustafizur Rahman, Dushmantha Chameera, Kuldeep Yadav, T NatarajanImpact Sub: Ashutosh SharmaSai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill (c), Jos Buttler (wk), Rahul Tewatia, Shahrukh Khan, Rashid Khan, Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore, Arshad Khan, Gerald Coetzee, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh KrishnaImpact Sub: Sherfane RutherfordSunday in Delhi is expected to be very warm with hazy sunshine, accompanied by a Yellow Alert for lightning until 2 PM.

However, spectators and players alike should prepare for the heat, as temperatures are expected to stay between 35°C and 39°C during the evening game. Stay hydrated and take necessary precautions if you're heading to the stadium.The DC vs GT match will be played at the Arun Jaitley stadium, Delhi. The match will start at 7:30 pm.

Punjab Kings (PBKS) will resume their IPL 2025 campaign against Rajasthan Royals (RR) on Sunday in Jaipur, aiming to strengthen their playoff hopes.PBKS, currently third with 15 points from 11 matches, return after an enforced break due to border tensions that caused their last game in Dharamsala to be abandoned. Despite the absence of key overseas players — Marcus Stoinis, Josh Inglis, and Marco Jansen — the team boasts a strong Indian core, including captain Shreyas Iyer, Priyansh Arya, Prabhsimran Singh, and Nehal Wadhera. Arshdeep Singh and Yuzvendra Chahal lead a formidable bowling attack, with Kyle Jamieson replacing the injured Lockie Ferguson.In contrast, RR have already been eliminated from playoff contention, sitting ninth with just three wins from 12 games. They’ve lost four of their last five matches and continue to miss captain Sanju Samson due to injury.The team’s struggles persist despite the emergence of 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi, whose century was a rare bright spot. With Jofra Archer opting out of the final matches, RR face a depleted bowling lineup. For their final home game, they will look to end on a high, relying on Yashasvi Jaiswal and Riyan Parag to deliver against a confident PBKS side.Expect a scorching afternoon in Jaipur with temperatures touching 42°C, which could test the players’ endurance. The pitch has slightly less grass covering than in earlier matches but remains a high-quality batting surface. The cracks on the wicket are firm and unmoving, indicating consistent bounce and minimal lateral movement. The ground dimensions are favourable for batters: around 60 meters to the left, slightly shorter at 57 meters on the right, and 69 meters straight down the ground. Given the conditions and pitch behaviour, a score of 190 should be considered par, especially on a hot and relatively windless day. Bowlers will need to rely more on variations and tactical execution than assistance from the surface.Yashasvi Jaiswal, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Riyan Parag (c), Kunal Singh Rathore, Dhruv Jurel (wk), Shimron Hetmyer, Wanindu Hasaranga, Kwena Maphaka, Maheesh Theekshana, Yudhvir Singh Charak, Akash MadhwalImpact Sub: Shubham DubeyPrabhsimran Singh (wk), Priyansh Arya, Mitchell Owen, Shreyas Iyer (c), Nehal Wadhera, Shashank Singh, Kyle Jamieson, Xavier Bartlett, Azmatullah Omarzai, Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep SinghImpact Sub: Harpreet BrarExpect a breezy and sun-drenched Sunday in Jaipur, with temperatures soaring. The day will be very warm, with a maximum of 42°C and a minimum of 31°C. Sunshine is expected throughout, and there's no chance of rain disrupting play. During game time (3–7 PM), conditions will remain hot, with temperatures hovering above 40°C.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on how IPL gave him a lifeline & his tribute to Phil Hughes

NEW DELHI: A crucial IPL 2025 fixture between Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) was washed out due to relentless rain at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday, leaving both teams with one point each.While the outcome brought disappointment to fans and players alike, it had vastly different consequences for the two sides.Rain began around 6 PM and never let up, with varying intensity throughout the evening. Hopes of any play gradually diminished, and with not even the toss possible, officials officially called off the match at 10:24 PM IST.For RCB, the point proved valuable. With 17 points from 12 games, they now sit comfortably at the top of the table, ahead of Gujarat Titans (16 points).A win from either of their remaining two matches, against the eliminated Sunrisers Hyderabad on May 23 or the Lucknow Super Giants on May 27, will secure their place in the playoffs. With strong recent form and momentum on their side, the Bengaluru outfit looks primed for a deep run in the tournament.In contrast, the washout spelled the end of KKR's playoff hopes. The defending champions have struggled with inconsistency this season, and the one-point finish in Bengaluru leaves them stranded at 11 points from 13 matches.Even if they beat Sunrisers Hyderabad in their final league match, they can only reach 13 points — mathematically eliminating them from contention.KKR's early exit marks a disappointing campaign after entering the tournament as defending champions. Meanwhile, RCB’s journey continues to build momentum as they close in on a playoff spot with renewed confidence and growing fan support.For now, the rain has decided the fate of one team and left the other with everything to play for.","IPL fixture between Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Kolkata Knight Riders washed out due to relentless rain at the M.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on how IPL gave him a lifeline & his tribute to Phil Hughes

NEW DELHI: At the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru, a surreal moment unfolded amid the gloom of a rain-soaked evening. As grey clouds loomed and the fate of the IPL 2025 clash between Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) hung in balance, a flock of white pigeons soared above the ground, a quiet, almost poetic salute to Virat Kohli and his recently concluded red-ball career.For fans in the stands, it felt as if even nature had paused to honour the legacy of one of cricket’s greats.While the symbolic flight of the pigeons stirred emotion, the practical mood was tense. Persistent rain delayed the toss and threatened to wash out one of the most anticipated matches of the season.Watch:IPL officials posted updates on X, confirming the weather-related disruption: “The toss has been delayed due to rain in Bengaluru. Stay tuned for further updates.”The rules are clear: if rain continues past 8:45 PM IST, overs will begin to be reduced. The cut-off time for a five-over match to begin is 10:56 PM IST, leaving fans with hope that some cricket might still be possible if the skies clear.For RCB, currently second with 16 points, a win would guarantee a playoff spot and likely a top-two finish, a huge advantage in the knockout stage. Their recent run of four consecutive wins has made them serious title contenders.Meanwhile, KKR face a do-or-die scenario. With just 11 points, they must win both remaining games and rely on other results to sneak into the playoffs.In a stadium filled with tribute T-shirts and soaked fans chanting Kohli’s name, the rain may have stalled the match, but not the spirit of cricket or the celebration of a legend.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) clash in IPL 2025.

Viktor Gyokeres caps stellar season with league-winning goal

“leader on and off the field”.

Benfica's draw hands the title to Sporting Lisbon

Sporting CP won their 20th Primeira Liga title in dramatic fashion on the last day of the Season 2024-25, beating Vitoria Guimaraes 2-0, while rivals Benfica were held 1-1 by Braga. Goals by Pedro Goncalves and Viktor Gyokeres secured the win, leaving Sporting two points clear of Benfica, for their second league title in four years. There were bright, exciting displays as Sporting produced the goods with relentless rhythm in the Jose Alvalade Stadium.Swedish forward Viktor Gyokeres added to an astonishing season with his 29th league goal in the final against Vitoria. His outstanding goal-scoring, however, not only inspired Sporting to triumph in the title but also saw him become valued as one of Europe’s top strikers and resulted in him attracting interest from several of the continent’s biggest clubs.Gyokeres is now the talisman of a team that has scored 43 goals in all competitions this term. The 25-year-old’s response in pressure situations has not gone unnoticed by boss Amorim, who described him as aBenfica went into the final round on equal points with Sporting, but had an inferior goal difference. A 1-1 draw against Braga, coupled with Sporting’s victory, left them two points off at the end of the season. Rodrigo Zalazar had offset a first-half penalty for Braga, and when Vangelis Pavlidis levelled, Benfica proved unable to find the winner they needed so desperately. The result wrapped up a disappointing season’s end for Roger Schmidt’s team, after they led the table for much of the early season.Also Read: Crystal Palace script history by winning FA Cup 2024-25 Sporting Lisbon now have the Taca de Portugal final on May 25 against Benfica, who they'll meet again in a bid to complete a domestic double.

Elsewhere around the league, Boavista and Farense were relegated, and the promoted club AVS will play Vizela in a playoff for a spot in next season’s top flight. This season's finale has only further burnished the reputation of Portuguese football, with Sporting's title win likely to echo across Europe.","Sporting Lisbon win 20th Primeira Liga title with 2-0 win over Vitoria Guimaraes.

Football pundits weigh in on the red card debate

In a thrilling FA Cup final at Wembley, Crystal Palace beat Manchester City 1–0 and won the greatest trophy in their 164-year club history.

Manchester City players made appeals to the referee, however, VAR decided that the incident did not meet the sending-off criteria and did not prevent a clear goal-scoring opportunity.

Reconciliation rumors and the current status of Lamine Yamal and Alex Padilla

Barcelona wonder-kid Lamine Yamal has been hitting the headlines not just for his football skills but also his personal life, notably his girlfriend TikTok star Alex Padilla . Their whirlwind romance has played out in the spotlight, from cosy kissing snaps to a dramatic split, only for rumours to subsequently emerge that they were back on.Lamine Yamal and Alex Padilla became known with Spain’s win over England in the Euro 2024 Final. Padilla went to the field to be with Yamal to celebrate his Young Player of the Tournament award, and the pair quickly became internet sensations cavorting in a series of affectionate routines. Their relationship appeared to be going strong as they jetted to various exotic locations, including Milan and Greece, posting their travel activities on the popular video app.However, their relationship hit a rough patch after a TikTok video went viral that seemed to show Padilla sitting on another man’s lap during a live stream. The videos also set off rumors of cheating, prompting Yamal to unfollow Padilla on Instagram. Padilla later explained that she was not sitting on anybody’s lap, but rather, she was sitting on a stool.Following the incident, Padilla experienced a significant drop in her social media following, losing over 100,000 followers on TikTok.

Melbourne: Australian Open, MCG, Australian GP and lots more

Crystal Palace etched their name into English football history with a stunning 1-0 win over Manchester City in the FA Cup final on Saturday, claiming their first major trophy in 120 years. Eberechi Eze’s exquisite 16th-minute volley proved decisive at Wembley, as the Eagles completed one of the most memorable cup upsets in recent times.While Eze’s clinical finish was the crowning moment of a remarkable personal journey — having been rejected by several London clubs in his youth — it was goalkeeper Dean Henderson who emerged as the true hero for Palace. The shot-stopper delivered a series of extraordinary saves, including a crucial penalty stop from Omar Marmoush late in the first half, ensuring City were left trophyless in a season for the first time since 2016-17.City, who had already surrendered their Premier League and Champions League ambitions, saw their miserable campaign hit a new low as Palace tactically outclassed them. Manager Oliver Glasner’s deep defensive setup and lightning counterattacks proved too much for Pep Guardiola’s experimental, holding-midfielder-less lineup.Guardiola’s gamble to overload his side with attacking players backfired spectacularly, with Palace punishing their lack of balance during a rapid break that led to Eze’s goal. The move was started by Jean-Philippe Mateta’s hold-up play and finished by Eze, who met Daniel Munoz’s inch-perfect cross with a sublime volley.City’s frustration boiled over when Henderson avoided a red card for a handball outside the area after rushing to challenge Erling Haaland — a decision upheld by VAR, much to Guardiola’s dismay. Minutes later, Marmoush missed from the spot, a blow from which City never recovered.Palace defended resolutely in the second half, with Henderson again denying Jeremy Doku and Claudio Echeverri in the dying moments to secure a famous win and a place in next season’s Europa League.For Palace, it was third time lucky after losing FA Cup finals in 1990 and 2016 — and a moment of glory fans will cherish forever. For City, it was a sobering afternoon that raised serious questions about their direction under Guardiola after a rare season without silverware.",Crystal Palace beat Manchester City 1-0 in the FA Cup final at Wembley.

Crystal Palace secured their first major silverware in style at Wembley Stadium on May 17, 2025, surprising Manchester City with a 1-0 FA Cup final victory. Eberechi Eze struck the all-important goal in the 16th minute as the Eagles escaped empty-handed while the champions dominated possession in a game that showcased Palace’s resilience and game-plan discipline.The game’s only goal did come early, with Eberechi Eze volleying home a cross from Daniel Muñoz after a quick counterattack prompted by Jean-Philippe Mateta’s hold-up work in the buildup. This early goal established the defensive context for Crystal Palace.And imperious as City were, there was little they could do to get beyond Crystal Palace's shape. Their best chance arrived when they were given a penalty, but Omar Marmoush's penalty was saved by goalkeeper Dean Henderson , making the right guess at the right time with a massive block. It was more shock for the City fans because it was Erling Haaland who was the designated penalty taker, but Marmoush took it instead.Dean Henderson did find himself in trouble when he handled the ball outside his penalty area to prevent a potential goal. The referee waved away protests at his decision not to show a red card, so Henderson remained on the field and continued his masterfully destructive work.Managed by Oliver Glasner, who had taken over in February 2024, Palace implemented a game plan that nullified City’s threats in attack. Glasner’s focus on defensive organisation and quick counter-attacks paid off, and one of Europe’s most powerful attacks was kept out.The result, being a first-ever FA Cup win for Crystal Palace, does seem to be a historic moment for the club, even though they'd been to two finals before. It not only ended their 120-year wait for a major trophy but FA Cup trophy. It also confirmed them as a formidable force in English football.Also Read: Pep Guardiola voices frustration over tight schedule before FA Cup fina As the whistle for the end of the game went, from the Crystal Palace end, the crowd went wild, those who had patiently waited since we were the underdogs, to witnessing us become the winners of the FA Cup.

Eberechi Eze scored the only goal of the game in the 16th minute. Goalkeeper Dean Henderson saved a penalty from Omar Marmoush.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121240097,imgsize-1577684,width-400,resizemode-4/Crystal-Palace.jpg"

However, the rain may skip the Round 9 race Sunday evening. Here’s the complete weather forecast for the Tokyo Formula E race.According to Metcheck.com, the weather in Tokyo is expected to remain pleasant at 21 degrees Celsius on Friday, though it will be a cloudy day.

He said, “In qualifying it was like, I was terrible. Nothing, you can't wake them [the tyres] up. In the race I was way more comfortable from the start, but the pace difference between me and some other guys was huge.

All about the Tokyo Street Circuit

The ABB FIA Formula E World Championship returns to Tokyo for Rounds 8 and 9, as the Tokyo E-Prix double header prepares to electrify the city’s street circuit with cutting-edge Gen3 Evo cars this weekend. After making its debut last year, the Tokyo race is back—poised to raise the bar even higher this season. Here's everything you need to know about the circuit set in the heart of Japan’s bustling capital.Formula E’s official X account recently shared a graphic video representation of the Tokyo Street Circuit , offering fans a clear glimpse of the track layout to be used for the upcoming races. The video highlights key features such as the Attack Mode zone, the acceleration zone, and the overtaking zone.Winner Maximilian Guenther had said after winning the Tokyo race last year, “The track is phenomenal. It’s super technical and super challenging for us and the teams to set everything up properly. To get super close to the walls, you have to have good confidence in the car, and there’s even jumps that we have in a lap, so it’s a big mixture of everything! For me that is what Formula E is all about, to race so tight around these street circuits.”Jaguar TCS Racing driver Nick Cassidy, who earned the ABB Driver of Progress Award with 12 overtakes during the race, praised the track as well. Reflecting on his experience, he said, “It was a mega, a proper Formula E track. Bumps, fast corners, on the limit and you’ve really got to attack in qualifying. I thought the track was fantastic.”Set in the heart of Tokyo Bay , the 2.575km circuit features 18 turns and boasts a compact, technical layout that includes three long straights and three chicane sequences. The strategically placed Attack Mode activation zone, located just outside Turn 4, adds a critical tactical element to the race.Also Read: Tokyo E-Prix double header: Race favourites, circuit challenges and what to expect Meanwhile, the tight Turns 1 and 2, along with the demanding Turns 10 and 11, are expected to become prime overtaking opportunities.

Who may dominate the Tokyo E-Prix this year

The Tokyo Street Circuit

After the massive success of its debut last year, which saw race tickets sell out in record time, the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship returns to Tokyo this weekend, on May 17–18. This year marks a significant milestone as the revolutionary GEN3 Evo cars will take to the streets of Japan’s capital for Rounds 8 and 9 of Season 11. Here’s all about the Tokyo E-Prix double header.Maximilian Gunther of Maserati MSG Racing, last season’s Tokyo winner, will be aiming to repeat his success. Oliver Rowland, who secured second place in that race and recently claimed victory in Monaco, will be looking to extend his podium streak in Tokyo. With a commanding 115-point lead in the Formula E Driver Standings, the Nissan driver enters his team’s home race as one of the top favorites, eager to capitalise on his strong performance in the first half of the 2024/25 championship.The pressure is also on his closest rivals from TAG Heuer Porsche Formula E Team – reigning champion Pascal Wehrlein and Season 6 champion António Felix da Costa – both determined to close the points gap.For Season 11, the street circuit in the middle of Tokyo Bay presents a fresh challenge for drivers and a thrilling experience for spectators, as the fastest-accelerating FIA single-seaters, the GEN3 Evo cars, prepare to navigate the narrow twists of downtown Tokyo.The 2.575 km track features 18 turns and a compact, technical layout, including three long straights and three chicane sequences. Strategically positioned on the outside of Turn 4, the Attack Mode activation zone will add a crucial tactical element to the race. Elsewhere, the tight Turns 1 and 2, along with the demanding Turns 10 and 11, are expected to be key overtaking zones, promising fans plenty of wheel-to-wheel action.Also Read: After Jeddah, Maximilian Gunther eyes another victory as Formula E heads to Tokyo Adding another layer of strategy to Saturday’s Round 8, the new Pit Boost feature will introduce high-stakes variables that could dramatically influence race outcomes for the 22 drivers on the grid.

Maximilian Gunther’s performance in current Formula E season



The Tokyo E-Prix is around the corner, and Formula E drivers are already looking to leave the Monaco hangover behind. Maximilian Gunther , who won the last Tokyo race as part of Maserati MSG Racing, has already secured one victory this season with DS Penske—in Jeddah—and will be aiming to continue his winning streak.Maximilian Gunther is the only Formula E driver this year to have converted a pole position into a win.He claimed victory in Jeddah Part 1, starting from pole and also recording the fastest lap. After clinching the win in Formula E Championship Round 3, he’ll be looking to replicate that success in Tokyo.After his Jeddah win, Günther shared a photo of himself with the trophy on Instagram, writing: “P1!!! What a race. What a day. What a feeling. Started from pole, dropped back to P9, and then fought back to take the win in the final corners, on the final lap. This one means everything! Today is a true testament to the hard work we’ve put in as a team over the past months, and it’s only the beginning. A massive thank you to everyone at @dsperformance and @ds_penske_fe, both here at the track and back at the factory. This win is for all of us.”However, Gunther couldn’t do much in his home city, Monaco, despite the double opportunities in the double header. He summed up his Monaco experience in a post that read: “Racing on the iconic streets of Monaco is always special. 🇲🇨 After a strong qualifying, we lined up P3 and gave it everything out there today. Unfortunately, we didn’t have the race pace and crossed the line in P8. Not the easiest weekend, but still walking away with two points finishes here.

I went to Monaco this weekend and now I am a mega fan of Formula E.”Nick was almost on cloud nine after bagging the podium spot in Monaco after a long time. He said after the Round 7 race, “It feels very, very sweet. I can’t fault my guys — it’s been an extremely tough start to the year, it’s no secret I’ve not been the happiest guy at times, but this one feels like a big monkey off the shoulders and I’m really proud of everyone’s efforts.

NEW DELHI: In a remarkable victory at the Italian Open on Saturday, Jasmine Paolini secured her second 1000 series championship by defeating Coco Gauff 6-4, 6-2, setting a positive tone before Roland Garros this month.The achievement marks Paolini as the first Italian woman to secure the Rome tournament since Raffaella Reggi's victory in 1985, demonstrating her superiority over former US Open champion Gauff.The packed centre court at the Foro Italico witnessed Paolini's triumph, potentially the first of three titles that could be secured by Italian players in this year's Rome tournament.At 29, Paolini has become the oldest first-time Rome champion in the Open Era. Meanwhile, Gauff, who is eight years younger, missed the opportunity to become the youngest victor since Serena Williams' achievement in 2002.Gauff's performance was hindered by 55 unforced errors and seven double faults on serve, similar to her semi-final match against Zheng Qinwen, which simplified Paolini's path to victory.Paolini could achieve additional success in the women's doubles tournament, where she and Sara Errani face Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens in Sunday's final.The last woman to win both singles and doubles titles in Rome was Monica Seles in 1990, whilst Vera Zvonareva remains the sole player to accomplish this feat in a 1000 series tournament at Indian Wells in 2009.The tournament continues with Paolini's fellow Italian Jannik Sinner set to compete against Carlos Alcaraz in Sunday's men's singles final.","Jasmine Paolini defeated Coco Gauff 6-4, 6-2 in the Italian Open final.

Sinner bounces back

Jannik Sinner set up a blockbuster Italian Open final with Carlos Alcaraz by beating Tommy Paul 1-6, 6-0, 6-3 on Friday.World number one Sinner fought back from a set down in front of a packed crowd to continue his march towards a first title at the Foro Italico .After a strangely slow start, Sinner again showed good form on centre court where, since returning to action last week from a three-month doping ban, he has taken his unbeaten run to 26 matches.And the 23-year-old will face down Alcaraz, the last man to beat Sinner in the final at the China Open in early October, with all eyes on another potential final between the pair at the French Open next month.A win for Sinner against his rival would see the men's Rome title go to an Italian for the first time since Adriano Panatta in 1976.""If I want to win Sunday I have to play one of my best tennis for sure,"" said Sinner.""Carlos has played incredible tennis today, so let's see what's coming but from my side you know incredible to be here in the final.""Alcaraz booked his place in the showdown by beating Sinner's countryman Lorenzo Musetti 6-3, 7-6 (7/4).The four-time Grand Slam champion overcame Musetti and the windy conditions in just over two hours to reach his fourth final of the season.""I'm going to have dinner, but my phone is going to be there watching (Sinner's) match,"" said Alcaraz after his win.""I have to know against who I'm going to play. I have to watch the match and see how they are going to play.""Musetti was beaten by Alcaraz in the Monte Carlo final last month and fell to his fifth straight defeat to the Spaniard after a frustrating display.And he believes that Alcaraz will have the better of it against Sinner if he brings his top form on Sunday evening.""I really rate Carlos. I think on clay that the best version of Carlos is favourite against anyone... that includes Jannik,"" he told reporters.Paul rattled off the first five games in 21 minutes in a near replica of what Sinner did to Casper Ruud on Thursday, closing out the first set in less than half an hour.The last time Sinner lost a set 6-1 was in the quarter-finals of the US Open against Daniil Medvedev, a match he won on his way to his second Grand Slam triumph.Sinner looked a shadow of the player who dominated tennis throughout 2024 right up to the start of his suspension, which was agreed with the World Anti-Doping Agency in early February.But from nowhere he came roaring back in the second set, finally forcing Paul back with some deep baseline shots of his own and his first aces of the match to win the second set to love and level the match.It was a complete role reversal with Paul now the one being thrown around the court, the world number 12 winning just 12 points in the second set and looking bewildered at how quickly the momentum shifted.Paul then handed Sinner the initiative with his second double fault of the night in game two of the third set. The Italian eventually won nine games in a row and marched on to victory.Earlier, Jasmine Paolini continued her bid to win the women's singles and doubles titles in Rome after reaching her second final of the week, this time alongside fellow Italian Sara Errani .Paolini and Errani, the reigning doubles champions, will meet Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens in the final on Sunday, before which Paolini could already be crowed singles champion.Late bloomer Paolini takes on Coco Gauff on Saturday aiming for her second 1000 series title at the age of 29 and to become the first Italian women to win in Rome since Raffaella Reggi in 1985.","Jannik Sinner will play Carlos Alcaraz in the Italian Open final.

Gauff joins Paolini

Jannik Sinner marched into the semi-finals of the Italian Open on Thursday after destroying Casper Ruud in straight sets 6-0, 6-1 as Coco Gauff won a marathon three-set battle with China's Zheng Qinwen to advance to the women's final.American Gauff will face Italy's Jasmine Paolini in Saturday's title match after pulling through 7-6 (7/3), 4-6, 7-6 (7/4) in a match that lasted over three-and-a-half hours.Ruud was supposed to be Sinner's toughest test in Rome since he came back from his three-month doping ban, as the Norwegian came into the match in hot form on clay after winning in Madrid earlier this month.In his previous matches Sinner looked to be still finding his feet after his suspension, accepted from the World Anti-Doping Agency for testing positive for traces of clostebol in March last year.But the 23-year-old demolished sixth seed Ruud in just over an hour with an ominous display of tennis, his domination such that the home fans at the packed centre court, seemingly out of sympathy, began to cheer the rare points that Ruud won.""I was feeling great on court today. I think we all saw that,"" said Sinner.""How I felt today was very, very positive signs for me... I was serving well and also returning well. Moving great on the court, so I'm very happy about that.""Ruud even got the loudest celebration of the match when he held his serve for the only time, in game three of the second set, holding his arms aloft in ironic joy.""He was just everywhere... it's just like playing a wall that you know shoots hundred miles an hour balls at you all the time,"" said a bewildered Ruud.Tommy Paul, a 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 winner over Hubert Hurkacz in the day's first match, will have wondered what on earth he can do to stop Sinner if the Italian brings that form to Friday's last-four clash.Sinner won the first set in just 27 minutes, giving up only seven points as he stalked the court with intent, dressed all in black as he has been all week.And he then maintained his record of not dropping a set in the tournament to not so much stroll as smash into the last four, and send a message to Carlos Alcaraz.Spaniard Alcaraz, Sinner's key Grand Slam rival ahead of the French Open, will contest the other semi-final with Lorenzo Musetti on Friday afternoon, with the blockbuster final tennis fans wanted still on.Gauff prevailed on a centre court left mostly empty by fans who headed for the exits in large numbers after watching Sinner's tennis clinic.Former US Open winner Gauff won her third straight match against Olympic gold medallist Zheng, after coming through a tie in which she made 15 double faults on serve and there were a combined total of 156 unforced errors.The 21-year-old is looking for her first title of the season after losing the Madrid final to Sabalenka, and against home hope Paolini will find herself in a much fiercer atmosphere than the soporific crowd which stayed till past midnight to watch her reach her second final of the year.""I told myself I'm ready to go home,"" said an exhausted Gauff.""It was tough for me, finding my rhythm especially at night, it was so slow, I just tried to stay in there.""I was frustrated. She forced me to get out of my comfort zone.""Sixth seed Paolini is the third Italian woman to reach the Foro Italico final, and the first since her doubles partner Sara Errani was thumped by Serena Williams in 2014.Late bloomer Paolini, 29, will have a chance to be the first woman from the Mediterranean nation to win in Rome since Raffaella Reggi in 1985, after beating Peyton Stearns 7-5, 6-1.""It's a privilege to be in this position. I matured late as a tennis player but everyone has their own path. Some mature earlier and some later,"" said Paolini.""I'm just enjoying it without thinking too much about the past.""Paolini could yet win both the singles and women's doubles tournaments, with her and Errani taking on Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider in the semi-finals on Friday.","Jannik Sinner thrashes Casper Ruud in straight sets 6-0, 6-1. Coco Gauff beats China's Zheng Qinwen to reach women's final. Gauff will face Italy's Jasmine Paolini in Saturday's title match. Tommy Paul beats Hubert Hurkacz in day's first match.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121200918,imgsize-24478,width-400,resizemode-4/Jannik-Sinner-Rome-AP.jpg"

Poll What do you think about Jannik Sinner's chances at the Italian Open? He will be eliminated early He will reach the finals He will win the title

Top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner met with Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican City on Wednesday during a break from the Italian Open , presenting the pontiff with a tennis racket and offering to play. The meeting came after the pope, known for his liking towards the sport, had earlier joked about not inviting Sinner, making a wordplay on the athlete's surname.The encounter took place in the Vatican's auditorium reception room, where Sinner arrived with his parents.""It's an honor,"" Sinner said in Italian as he presented the pope with a racket and ball, suggesting a quick volley.The 69-year-old American pope, who hails from Chicago, declined the offer to play, looking at the surrounding antiques and saying, ""Better not.""Leo XIV made a light-hearted comment about his white cassock being appropriate for Wimbledon, referencing the tournament's all-white dress code. The meeting included discussions about Sinner's progress in the Italian Open, where he faces a quarterfinal match on Thursday against Madrid champion Casper Ruud.Sinner is returning to competition after a three-month doping ban, which was determined to be due to accidental contamination.The Italian player is aiming to become the first from his country to claim the Rome title since Adriano Panatta's victory in 1976.During the interaction, Italian Tennis and Padel Federation head Angelo Binaghi presented the pope with an honorary federation card. ""We all felt the passion that Leo XIV has for our sport and this filled us with pride,"" Binaghi stated. ""We hope to embrace the Holy Father again soon, maybe on a tennis court.""The meeting included a photo session featuring the Davis Cup trophy, which Sinner helped Italy secure for the second consecutive year. The Billie Jean King Cup trophy, won by Italy in 2024, was also displayed during the meeting.Earlier in the week, Sinner had responded positively to the pope's initial joke, noting it was ""a good thing for us tennis players"" to have a pope who enjoys the sport.Beyond tennis, Pope Leo XIV is known to be a devoted Chicago White Sox baseball fan, following in the tradition of his predecessor, Pope Francis, who supported the Buenos Aires football club San Lorenzo.","Top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner met with Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican City on Wednesday during a break from the Italian Open.
