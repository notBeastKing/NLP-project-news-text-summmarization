Several eyewitness accounts capture aftermath of large explosion near Palm Springs, California





A powerful bomb exploded outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, on Saturday, killing one person and injuring at least four others in what the FBI has officially declared an act of terrorism.“This is an intentional act of terrorism,” said Akil Davis, the head of the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, during a press briefing near the site. He added, “This is probably one of the largest bombing investigations that we've had in Southern California.”The explosion ripped through downtown Palm Springs around 11 am (local time), blowing out windows across several blocks and collapsing part of the American Reproductive Centers building.Authorities believe the blast originated from a vehicle in or near the clinic’s parking lot. A charred car axle was all that remained at the scene. Davis confirmed the deceased was near the blast but did not release their identity, citing the need to protect the investigation.According to AP, officials believe the person killed may have been the perpetrator.An AK-47-style rifle was also recovered from the site.While the motive remains unclear, Davis said the clinic “was deliberately targeted.” The FBI has not specified whether the act was domestic or international terrorism.Authorities are also investigating whether the explosion was livestreamed.The clinic confirmed that all staff are safe and that its laboratory, which stores embryos and reproductive materials, was not damaged. “Thank God today happened to be a day that we have no patients,” Dr Maher Abdallah, who leads the clinic, was quoted as saying by AP.The force of the blast was immense, scattering debris across a five-lane street and damaging nearby buildings, including a liquor store and a hospital. As per The New York Times, one witness said the car parts were “blown clear across four lanes.”Palm Springs police chief Andy Mills assured residents that the bombing was an isolated incident and there was no ongoing threat. However, as a precaution, Planned Parenthood closed 19 centres across Southern California.US attorney general Pam Bondi condemned the attack in a statement posted online, calling it “unforgivable,” and adding, “The Trump administration understands that women and mothers are the heartbeat of America.”The Center for Reproductive Rights called the bombing “horrific” and demanded stronger protections for clinics, stating that patients must “feel safe.”Investigators from the FBI, ATF and local agencies remain at the scene, collecting evidence in what could become a landmark terrorism case in California.","A powerful bomb exploded outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, on Saturday, killing one person and injuring at least four others.

What exactly happened on that day?

What Lufthansa flight said?







A Lufthansa aircraft flying from Germany to Spain, was operated without a pilot for 10 minutes in 2024, according to German news agency dpa's Saturday report.This frightening incident happened on February 17, 2024, when one of the pilots lost consciousness in the cockpit, and another captain was off using the bathroom alone in the cockpit.The mid-air saga unfolded when the Airbus A321 -- carrying 199 passengers and six crew members -- was en route from Frankfurt, Germany to Seville, Spain.According to the senior pilot, aged 43, whose name was not mentioned in the report, he left his 38-year-old colleague in charge while visiting the toilet, with approximately 30 minutes of journey time left. He observed that his colleague seemed competent and vigilant before departing.Upon returning after approximately eight minutes, the captain discovered he couldn't enter the cockpit despite multiple attempts with the security code. The situation escalated when his intercom call received no response, New York Post reported.In response to the concerning situation, the captain resorted to using an emergency access code.The first officer regained consciousness shortly afterwards.""Before the emergency access code timer expired, the co-pilot opened the flight deck door manually from the inside,"" according to the report, noting the captain promptly resumed control of the aircraft.""As the co-pilot was pale, sweating and moving strangely, the captain called for assistance from the cabin crew. The co-pilot was given first aid by the crew and a doctor, who was traveling as a passenger and diagnosed a possible heart condition.""The first officer later informed officials about his uncertainty regarding the duration of his unconsciousness.“The loss of consciousness was so sudden that he was unable to warn the other crew members of his incapacitation.”Dpa reported that Lufthansa acknowledged the investigation report and confirmed their flight safety department's separate inquiry, though the results remained undisclosed.The aircraft maintained stable flight conditions due to the engaged autopilot, despite inadvertent control inputs from the unconscious co-pilot. The voice recorder documented unusual sounds within the cockpit, indicating a medical emergency, according to dpa.The captain attempted access using the standard door code five times, which activates a cockpit buzzer for co-pilot response, but was unsuccessful. A cabin crew member attempted to reach the co-pilot via the aircraft's internal communication system.Subsequently, the captain entered an emergency access code for autonomous door operation. However, dpa reported that the unwell co-pilot managed to open the door from inside moments before the automatic override would have activated.The captain subsequently diverted the aircraft to Madrid, where medical personnel attended to the co-pilot at a local hospital.","A Lufthansa aircraft flying from Germany to Spain, was operated without a pilot for 10 minutes in 2024.

‘Are they tapping us along?’: Marco Rubio on Moscow’s intentions after direct talks between Russia-Ukraine stall,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/are-they-tapping-us-along-marco-rubio-on-moscows-intentions-after-direct-talks-between-russia-ukraine-stall/articleshow/121243361.cms,"File photo: US secretary of state Marco Rubio (Picture credit: AP)

Secretary Rubio says Trump wants summit with Russia's Putin ""as soon as feasible""





US secretary of state Marco Rubio said on Saturday that he remains wary of Russia’s intentions in the Ukraine peace process, warning that Moscow could be “tapping us along” after the first direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine in three years failed to produce a ceasefire.In an interview with CBS News’ Face the Nation airing Sunday, Rubio confirmed he spoke by phone with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov to get a readout on Friday’s talks in Istanbul.“They were not a complete waste of time,” he said, but added, “Are they tapping us along? Well, that’s what we’re trying to find out.”The Istanbul meeting ended in under two hours without agreement on a ceasefire, though both sides consented to a prisoner exchange involving 1,000 captives each. Russian President Vladimir Putin rejected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s offer for a face-to-face meeting in Turkey, instead sending a lower-level delegation.Rubio acknowledged the delicate balance between patience and urgency. “On the one hand, we’re trying to achieve peace and end a very bloody, costly and destructive war… On the other hand, we don’t have time to waste,” he said, stressing that broader global issues also demand attention.He also indicated that progress would likely hinge on a direct Trump-Putin meeting. “The president wants to do it. He wants to do it as soon as feasible,” he said, noting that preparations for such a summit, including the choice of location and timing, had yet to be finalised. Rubio said the Vatican, which has offered to host peace talks, could be a “comfortable” setting for all parties.The remarks come ahead of a high-stakes Monday, when US President Donald Trump is expected to speak with both Putin and Zelenskyy by phone. “Hopefully it will be a productive day, a ceasefire will take place, and this very violent war, a war that should have never happened, will end,” Trump wrote on social media.While Trump has continued to project confidence in his ability to broker peace, recent escalations on the ground raise doubts about any imminent breakthrough. On Saturday, a Russian drone attack on a civilian bus in Ukraine’s Sumy region killed nine people and wounded several others, according to Ukrainian officials. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy condemned the strike as a “deliberate attack on civilians.”Zelenskyy has agreed to Trump’s demand for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire, but Ukrainian officials remain sceptical about the US administration’s shifting approach. “Such inconsistency, illogical steps and lack of strategy undermine US credibility,” said Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of Ukraine’s parliamentary foreign affairs committee, according to the New York Times.Critics argue Trump’s posture risks rewarding Russia’s hardline position while cornering Ukraine into concessions. Mick Ryan, a defence analyst quoted by New York Times, said, “Putin’s primary goal is snuffing out Ukraine’s democracy and culture, denying it agency in its own affairs.”As world leaders gathered in Rome for Pope Leo XIV ’s inaugural Mass, Rubio, attending the ceremony, said the new pope had made a “very generous offer” to host peace talks. In his first blessing, Pope Leo urged all parties to strive for “an authentic, just and lasting peace.”","Secretary Rubio says Trump wants summit with Russia's Putin ""as soon as feasible"" Secretary Rubio confirmed he spoke by phone with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov to get a readout on Friday’s talks in Istanbul.

Who is Tiffany Slaton? Woman who survived 24 days lost in Sierra Mountains by living on wild leeks and snow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-tiffany-slaton-woman-who-survived-24-days-lost-in-sierra-mountains-by-living-on-wild-leeks-and-snow/articleshow/121241792.cms,"(Source: X)





A 28-year-old woman from Georgia who went missing in California's Sierra Nevada mountains has stunned authorities and her family with a survival story described as “movie-worthy,"" reports the New York Times. Tiffany Slaton , a travelling dialysis technician and outdoors lover from Jeffersonville, Georgia, has been found safe after surviving 24 days alone in the snowy mountains of California.Slaton's journey began as a short three-day solo camping trip near Shaver and Huntington Lakes, but later turned into a fight for survival that took her more than 40 miles off track, all the way to Vermilion Valley Resort During her time in the wild, Tiffany faced 13 snowstorms, an avalanche, and a serious fall from a cliff. She lost her tent, her bike, and most of her supplies.The journey started on April 20 and soon became very tough. Slaton took her electric bike and camping gear, including two sleeping bags and a tent. Early on, she fell off a cliff and was unconscious for about two hours. When she woke up, she made a splint for one leg and “popped the other knee back into place,” NBC News reports.She had no signal and her phone’s map didn’t work.She tried calling 911 five times, but none went through. At one point, she even asked her phone where the nearest Starbucks was; it said 18 miles away.Her family reported her missing on April 29, and a large-scale search followed, covering roughly 600 square miles. Local authorities and volunteers collectively travelled over 4,000 miles on foot and by vehicle. A helicopter was also deployed, but no trace of her was found until this week.Slaton stayed alive by eating wild leeks and boiling snow for water. She also made tea each day using pine needles and manzanita. To keep herself calm, she wrote in a journal every day.She finally reached Vermilion Valley Resort, hidden deep in the Sierra mountains and often cut off by snow. The cabin she found was unlocked, and the resort owner keeps it that way in case lost hikers need a place to stay.“I thought I had somehow managed to make it to the North Pole,” Slaton said, describing the moment she saw the cabin. Inside, she found a sleeping bag, which she called “the best sleeping bag I had ever seen.”The next day, just before her 28th birthday, the resort owner came. The roads had only just been cleared. “She pops out, didn’t say a word, just ran up, and all she wanted was a hug,” he said. “That’s when I realised who this was.”“She said, ‘Dad, I’m alive, and I’m sorry,’” her father Bobby was quoted as saying to NBC News. “Those prayers were answered.”Fresno County Sheriff John Zanoni called her tale one “they would make movies about.” His colleague Tony Botti added, “She’s a fighter. She’s not going to give up.”","Tiffany Slaton, 28, from Georgia, went missing in California's Sierra Nevada mountains on April 29.

One person killed in explosion outside fertility clinic; police say act was ‘intentional’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/one-person-killed-in-explosion-outside-fertility-clinic-police-say-act-was-intentional/articleshow/121242923.cms,"AP photo





The FBI says the explosion that damaged a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, was an “intentional act of terrorism.”Akil Davis, the head of the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, said Saturday evening that the clinic was deliberately targeted.He declined to elaborate on how authorities have reached a conclusion on a motive.Authorities were still working to confirm the identity of the person who died at the scene. Davis would not directly say whether that person was the suspect but said authorities were not searching for a suspect.Davis also said four people were hurt but provided no additional details on the severity of the injuries.Authorities were also investigating the possibility that the explosion was being livestreamed, Davis said.THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.(AP) — An explosion that heavily damaged a fertility clinic Saturday in the upscale California city of Palm Springs was apparently intentional, local authorities said. One person was found dead, and the FBI said it was sending investigators, including bomb technicians, to the scene.Palm Springs Police Chief Andy Mills said in a statement that the blast “appears to be an intentional act of violence” and that several buildings were damaged, some severely.“There has been one fatality, the person’s identity is not known,” Mills said.The act was being investigated as a possible car explosion, according to two law enforcement officials briefed on the matter who insisted on anonymity to discuss preliminary information from an ongoing investigation. One of the officials told AP that investigators believe the person who died was likely the person who set off the explosion, but they cautioned that the investigation was still in its early stages. Authorities have not disclosed a motive.Attorney General Pam Bondi said federal agents were working to learn more about the explosion, adding, “Let me be clear: the Trump administration understands that women and mothers are the heartbeat of America. Violence against a fertility clinic is unforgivable.”The FBI's Los Angeles field office said via the social platform X that “assets being deployed include investigators, bomb technicians & an evidence response team.” Investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were also assisting.The city of Palm Springs said the explosion happened at 11 a.m. and residents were asked to avoid the area around North Indian Canyon Drive near East Tachevah Drive.Dr. Maher Abdallah, who runs the American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic, confirmed that his facility was damaged. He told AP in a phone interview that all staffers were safe and accounted for. The explosion damaged the practice’s office space, where it conducts consultations with patients, but the IVF lab and the stored embryos were spared.“I really have no clue what happened,” Abdallah said. “Thank God today happened to be a day that we have no patients.”Aerial video showed a burned-out car in a parking lot behind the building that housed the fertility clinic’s office space. The blast caved in the roof and blew a wide debris field across a sidewalk and four lanes of the street on the other side of the structure.Rhino Williams, 47, said he was chatting with customers at a restaurant he helps manage inside the Skylark Hotel just over a block away when he heard a huge boom. Everything rattled, Williams said, and he sprinted to the scene to see if anyone was in need of help.Williams saw a large dark gray plume of smoke and covered his nose with his shirt as he smelled burning plastic and rubber. He said he saw a building had “blown out” into the street, with bricks and debris scattered everywhere, and he spotted a car’s front axle on fire in the parking lot.He said it was the only car in the lot that he saw. He ran into the building, calling out and peering behind the counter to see if anyone was inside. He did not hear a response and did not see anyone behind the counter.Williams then ran around to check on other buildings. Multiple windows of the neighboring liquor store were also blown out, he said. Once he saw authorities arrive, he headed back to the hotel.Nima Tabrizi, 37, of Santa Monica, said he was inside a cannabis dispensary nearby when he felt a massive explosion.“The building just shook, and we go outside and there’s massive cloud smoke,” Tabrizi said. “Crazy explosion. It felt like a bomb went off. ... We went up to the scene, and we saw human remains.”Palm Springs is about a two-hour drive east of Los Angeles. Its known for upscale resorts, golf courses and a history of celebrity residents.","The FBI says the explosion that damaged a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, was an ‘intentional act of terrorism’ Authorities are still working to confirm the identity of the person who died at the scene.

"UAE pours money into Africa, seeking resources, power",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/uae-pours-money-into-africa-seeking-resources-power/articleshow/121242364.cms,"President Donald Trump speaks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia (NYT photo)





Look at the chief economic and strategic spots across Africa — ports for key trade corridors, mines that produce critical minerals, large renewable energy projects — and you will find the United Arab Emirates. As the United States and, to a lesser extent, China reduce their investment, aid and presence on the continent, the Emirates is using its enormous wealth to fill the void. Persian Gulf investments in Africa, primarily by the Emirates, have exploded in recent years. Since 2019, $110 billion worth of deals — mostly by firms tightly aligned with the ruling powers — have been announced, dwarfing amounts pledged by any other country. “The UAE is turning into a dominant foreign player” in much of Africa, said Anna Jacobs, a nonresident fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.Its efforts to become a world leader, particularly in finance and technology, are likely to be bolstered under President Trump, Jacobs said. The President, seeking to draw Emirati money to the United States, paved the way this week for the sale of American advanced artificial intelligence chips to the Emirates.Like other oil-producing nations in the Persian Gulf, the Emirates is looking to diversify its economy away from fossil fuels, and it sees Africa as an essential part of the plan.The continent has vast mineral resources, a growing population, agricultural potential and a strategically important location bordering the Red and Mediterranean seas as well as the Indian and Atlantic oceans.Powerhouse Emirati corporations based in Dubai and Abu Dhabi with political connections are in dozens of countries across Africa. AMEA Power is already building or operating clean energy plants in Burkina Faso, Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Morocco, South Africa, Togo, Tunisia and Uganda and has plans to expand. Abu Dhabi National Energy has projects in Morocco, Senegal and South Africa. DP World , the gargantuan govt-backed ports and logistics operator, has invested billions of dollars in ports and economic free zones from Algeria to Zambia, including in the Berbera port city in the breakaway republic of Somaliland, where the Emirates also has a military base.Last year, the Emirati International Holding invested more than $1 billion for a 51% share in the Mopani Copper Mines in Zambia.Spending in Egypt has also soared. Last year, the Emirates agreed to invest $35 billion to develop a new city and tourism destination on Egypt’s Mediterranean coast.Once the biggest foreign investor on the continent through its Belt and Road Initiative, China still has a large presence, but Beijing has pulled back in recent years after a series of debt crises in Africa and at home.In 2022 and 2023, the Emirates announced a total of $97 billion in investments in Africa — three times China’s total, according to fDi Markets, a database of foreign investments. US investment in 2023 was about $10 billion.Meanwhile, Trump has fast-tracked the US’ exit from Africa, ending billions of dollars in funding, dismantling the USAID and ending all contributions to the African Development Bank.","The United Arab Emirates is using its enormous wealth to fill the void.

The New York University decided to withhold the diploma of Logan Rozos , a student who chose to condemn Israel's war in Gaza as 'genocide' at the graduation speech, keeping the administration in dark. His speech drew loud cheers from the audience while the administration said NYU was deeply sorry that the audience had to listen to these remarks.NYU spokesperson John Beckman said Logan's speech was approved previously but on the stage, he deviated from his speech and now the university will take disciplinary action against him.""He lied about the speech he was going to deliver and violated the commitment he made to comply with our rules,"" Beckman said. ""NYU is deeply sorry that the audience was subjected to these remarks and that this moment was stolen by someone who abused a privilege that was conferred upon him.""“The only thing that is appropriate to say in this time, and to a group this large, is a recognition of the atrocities currently happening in Palestine,” Rozos said to an applauding crowd at the Beacon Theatre.“I want to say that the genocide currently occurring is supported politically and militarily by the United States, is paid for by our tax dollars,” he said.“I just want to say I condemn this genocide and complicity in this genocide,” Rozos concluded.Rozos, who is an actor and a member of the Gallatin Theatre Troupe, was chosen to deliver the address. Anti-Defamation Leauge condemned the speech and said no student, especially no Jewish students should have to sit through politicised rhetoric that ""promotes harmful lies about Israel during such a personal milestone"".Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D.-Fla.) said the university has every right to withhold the diploma because he lied to the university. “He lied to the university. Second of all, he lied to everyone listening. There’s no genocide going on in Israel. There is a war, it’s unfortunate,” Moskowitz said“You know, in fact, they can give him his diploma, it’s not going to matter. Good luck getting a job.

‘Eat the tariffs’: Donald Trump scolds Walmart after retailer blames import taxes for price hikes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/eat-the-tariffs-donald-trump-scolds-walmart-after-retailer-blames-import-taxes-for-price-hikes/articleshow/121241541.cms,"



US President Donald Trump on Saturday told Walmart to “eat the tariffs” after the retail giant warned that it would have to raise prices because of the new import taxes . Trump said that the retail giant should not blame tariffs for the price hikes.The US’s biggest retailer recently said that tariffs, even at reduced levels, would soon force price increases on many of its products. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon explained that while the company would try to keep prices low, it could not “absorb all the pressure” caused by the tariffs.In response, Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, to scold Walmart. “Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain,” he wrote. “Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected.”Trump urged Walmart to keep prices down despite the tariffs. “EAT THE TARIFFS,” he said, adding, “I’ll be watching, and so will your customers.”Walmart’s warning comes amid growing concerns over inflation and rising costs, with Trump pushing to keep prices stable as part of his trade policy. About one-third of Walmart’s products come from overseas, with many imported from China and Mexico.The company sells a wide range of affordable goods to millions of Americans and says 90% of the population is its customers, according to the New York Times.Many retailers have avoided raising prices so far by stockpiling goods. Walmart is seen as somewhat protected because many of its groceries are sourced within the United States. However, the company has stopped projecting profits for the current quarter due to the uncertainty caused by tariffs.Walmart reported a sales increase of over 3%, reaching $112 billion in the last quarter, and expects revenue growth of 3% to 4% for the year. Walmart is one of several companies warning that shoppers could soon face higher prices as import taxes drive up costs.","US President Donald Trump told Walmart to ""eat the tariffs"" after the retail giant warned that it would have to raise prices.

US President Donald Trump has reignited his long-running feud with Hillary Clinton by sharing a controversial video, as if defeating her in the 2016 election was not enough for the Republican leader.The clip shared suggests that several people who opposed or questioned the Clintons ended up dead.In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump uploaded a video compilation titled “The video Hillary Clinton does not want you to see.” The video implies that numerous figures who were considered hostile, critical, or potentially threatening to Hillary Clinton or her family died under suspicious circumstances.The video doesn’t directly blame Hillary Clinton, but its message is clear and has stirred up conspiracy talk on social media again.Right-wing commentator Laura Loomer reacted to the video on X, saying, “Trump took a blow torch to Hillary Clinton.” She added, “Isn’t it weird how so many people who surround the Clintons have been found dead, been murdered or died from ‘suicide’?”The claims made in the video remain unverified and widely dismissed by mainstream sources as a conspiracy theory.","Donald Trump has shared a video on his social media platform Truth Social.

Obama's daughter accused of copying indie creator's short film: 'I was disappointed and hurt',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/obamas-daughter-accused-of-copying-indie-creators-short-film-i-was-disappointed-and-hurt/articleshow/121241208.cms,"An indie creator accused Malia Obama of stealing her work for a big brand commercial that Malia recently made.

Who is Malia Obama?







Indie filmmaker Natalie Jasmine Harris has accused former president Barack Obama's daughter Malia of copying her short film Grace in her Nike advertisement. Harris said she met Malia at Sundance in 2024 when her 'Grace' and Malia Obama's 'The Heart' were both in competition. Harris made a post on X earlier this month about the shocking similaries and the exact scene which she felt was copied from her film.Harris told Business Insider that two people playing pat-a-cake was the scene that was similar and to this accusation many people told her that she didn't invent pat-a-cake. ""And that's very true. But it's not about the game. It's about the cinematic tools used to depict it,"" Harris said.""Initially, I was disappointed and hurt — not just for myself but for my entire team. I sent the commercial to friends who had the same reaction I did. One put together a shot-by-shot photo comparison,"" she said.""My cinematographer, Tehillah De Castro, noted a lot of similarities from a technical perspective, from the camera angles to the shots to the framing composition and the color palette.""""It speaks to a larger issue of brands not supporting independent artists and opting for folks who already have name recognition, which doesn't breed innovative films or original storytelling. If they wanted these shots that were similar to my shots, why not hire me to direct?""'I was hesitant since it involves former president's daughter'Harris said she would like some acknowledgement from Nike or Malia Obama.""I was initially hesitant to speak out, since it involves a former president's daughter and a beloved brand like Nike...But I've poured too much into my work to just sit by and watch,"" she said.Barack and Michelle's eldest daughter Malia Obama is a writer, director. In 2021, Malia graduated from Harvard with a Bachelor of Arts degree in History. But film was her key interest and she many prestigious internships. In 2014 she was a production assistant on the set of “Extant” and even worked in the writer’s room for HBO’s “Girls” in 2015.In 2017, Malia had a quick stint at The Weinstein Company in 2017. By the time, she ended college, she was fully working in the entertainment industry, In 2023, she doubted as a writer on Donald Glover’s viral Amazon Prime Video limited series “Swarm"".

Human rights violations in Sindh





Jeay Sindh Freedom Movement ( JSFM ), a political group advocating for Sindhu Desh, staged a peaceful sit-in protest on a highway in Pakistan on Friday, demanding the release of missing and jailed Sindhi nationalists. With traffic halted and slogans echoing through the air, the group sought global attention to enforced disappearances , illegal detentions, and human rights abuses in Sindh and Balochistan.JSFM leaders, including chairman Sohail Abro, Zubair Sindhi, and Amar Azadi, called for the immediate release of Zahid Channa, Sajad Channa, Adnan Baloch, Badshah Baloch, Rafiqat Manghanhar, and Shahid Soomro. They also demanded that false charges against them be withdrawn and that all forcibly arrested persons be freed.""This peaceful sit-in serves as a protest against the unlawful arrests of our nationalist activists, the abuses occurring in jails, and the enforced disappearances. Our effort is peaceful and democratic, and we will persist until our people are free,"" the collective statement read.The protestors warned the Hyderabad Jail authorities against further mistreatment of detainees and threatened to block the prison’s main gate if abuse continued.They also called out to international organisations like the UN, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch, urging intervention and global condemnation of Pakistan's rights violations.A 2022 US State Department report, had pointed out widespread cases of extrajudicial killings and the recovery of mutilated bodies across Sindh.In 2024, Abro had also appealed for help in the case of Priya Kumari, a missing Hindu girl, stressing rising cases of forced conversions and marriages to Muslim men.Sindhis have been historically struggling for identity and autonomy. They accuse the Pakistani state of erasing local culture through systemic oppression—citing Urdu imposition, the ‘One unit’ policy, and historic land grabs like the removal of Karachi from Sindh.Meanwhile, in related developments, Balochistan declared independence from Pakistan this week. On social media, hashtags like #RepublicOfBalochistan trended, with users sharing proposed flags and maps.","Jeay Sindh Freedom Movement (JSFM) staged a peaceful sit-in protest on a highway in Pakistan on Friday, demanding the release of missing and jailed Sindhi nationalists.

Pakistan’s high commissioner to Bangladesh, Syed Ahmed Maroof , has abruptly gone on leave after videos of his alleged honeytrap surfaced online, according to Bangladeshi daily Prothom Alo.Maroof left Dhaka on the morning of 11 May, travelling to Islamabad via Dubai. That same day, the Pakistan high commission in Dhaka formally notified Bangladesh’s ministry of foreign affairs of his departure, a senior ministry official told Prothom Alo on Tuesday.Diplomatic sources in Dhaka suggest that Maroof’s recall may be linked to controversy surrounding a personal visit to Cox’s Bazar during the recent India-Pakistan conflict, and his alleged association with a female Bangladeshi government official, Daily Sun reported.Under diplomatic protocol, when an ambassador takes leave, the host country’s foreign ministry is informed of the duration and who will assume responsibilities in the interim. While the Pakistan high commission confirmed that deputy high commissioner Muhammad Asif will serve as acting high commissioner, no timeframe for Maroof’s leave was provided in official communication, Prothom Alo noted.Maroof had played a high-profile role in Dhaka and Islamabad ties, particularly following the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government on 5 August 2024, in the wake of a student-led uprising.Rumours of the scandal escalated after photos and alleged intimate videos surfaced online, showing Maroof with a Bangladeshi woman.

NEW DELHI: Early in March, the US arrested in Afghanistan an ISIS-K operative involved in the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing that killed 13 Marines. President Donald Trump was quick to thank Pakistan for its help in nabbing the high-value fugitive from the Pak-Afghan border. ""I want to thank the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster,"" he told US Congress.But what was brushed under the carpet was an open secret in intelligence circles: The operative, Sharifullah, had been in Pakistan spy agency ISI's custody for over a year. ISI ran multiple operations using his network and ultimately handed him over to the CIA at the right time - when the regime changed in Washington.This was not the first instance of Pakistan trying to please the US by handing over terrorists that it had been using to achieve its own goals. ISI had played the same trick in 2010 when it 'suddenly discovered' Taliban military commander Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar and handed him over to CIA.The case of Osama bin Laden and his courier, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, further exposed the duplicity of Pakistan and its military-industrial complex. Pakistani intelligence agencies had claimed they had no knowledge of Osama's presence in Abbottabad despite the compound where he was staying being just about a kilometre away from the Pakistan Military Academy.The Americans, it appears, didn't believe the Pakistanis and kept on hunting for the 9/11 plotter.But while his capture and killing vindicated the US's lack of trust in Islamabad, American leaders continued to allow themselves to be baited by the Pakistanis. Trump, who considers himself to be the greatest deal maker, seems to be the latest victim of Pakistan's dual game, feeling beholden to the favour that ISI did by offering Sharifullah as a trophy.Sharifullah and Osama are not standalone cases. In 2002, a bombing at nightclubs in Bali had left over 200 people dead, including several Americans. The prime suspect was Umar Patek, a suspected member of the militant group Jemaah Islamiyah. The US had announced a $1 million bounty on him.On January 25, 2011, Patek was dramatically captured by Pakistani officials in Abbottabad and handed over to the US, which then passed him on to Indonesia as a gesture which ""demonstrated the international cooperation between the US and Indonesia in addressing terrorism"". Pakistan had similarly arrested Osama's man Friday Abu Zubaydah in Faisalabad six months after the 9/11 attacks. He was swiftly transferred to CIA custody.These capture-extraditions, though seen as attempts by Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to counter-terrorism, have actually been selective and strategic, aimed at appeasing the US rather than genuinely combating terrorism, a senior officer said.","US arrested in Afghanistan an ISIS-K operative involved in the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing that killed 13 Marines.

Pakistan’s misinformation campaign was exposed yet again after its claim that the man leading funeral prayers for terrorists was an innocent preacher turned out to be blatant lie and the man in question was identified as a designated global terrorist During a press conference, Pakistan’s DG-ISPR (Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations) had flashed the national ID card of a man with a similar name, Abdul Rauf, claiming that he was a preacher and a member of the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League (PMML) party.However, details from the same bio-data exposed the intricate web of misinformation spun by the ISI. It turned out that Abdul Rauf was not a preacher or Masood Azhar’s slain brother with the same name but a different individual with ties to Lashkar-eTaiba. The man, Hafiz Abdul Rauf , is a ‘specially designated global terrorist’ (SDGT) by the US department of treasury and is also on the SDN (Specially Designated Nationals) list of the US government.Pakistan’s lies were busted from their computerised national identity card (CNIC) number visible in the document flashed by DG ISPR Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif. The number 35202-5400413-9 on the document is the same as the one listed by the US treasury and the Office of Foreign Assets Control which incidentally also lists Lt Gen Sharif’s father, Mahmood Sultan Bashiruddin, as a designated terrorist with ties to al-Qaida.In the press conference held by DG ISPR during Operation Sidoor, a Pakistan Air Force officer also claimed to have shown “tactical brilliance” in Pulwama, which is being interpreted as an acknowledgement of the Pakistani military’s role in the 2019 Pulwama terror attack that killed 40 CRPF personnel.They then went on to allege that India’s claims of Abdul Rauf being a terrorist were not true.Incidentally, the same photograph of Abdul Rauf at the burial was used by India to identify and release the names of senior Pakistan army personnel and key police officials who attended the funeral of terrorists — including high-ranking officers such as Lt Gen Fayyaz Hussain Shah and Inspector General of Police Usman Anwar.According to the US treasury department, Hafiz Abdul Rauf, a member of LeT’s senior leadership since 1999, is the chief of Falah-i-Insaniat Foundation, operating LeT’s relief activities in disguise.","Pakistan had claimed that the man leading the prayers was Abdul Rauf, a preacher and member of Pakistan Markazi Muslim League.

Sri Lanka: How period poverty keeps girls out of school,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/sri-lanka-how-period-poverty-keeps-girls-out-of-school/articleshow/121184554.cms,"Representative AI photo

'Some teachers will buy pads for us'



Cloth pads can be unsafe



Government initiatives fall short



New vouchers expected this year







When 14-year-old Janani gets her period, she doesn't always make it to school. Some days, there are no sanitary pads at home, and Janani is forced to use a pad made from old clothes. On those days, she skips classes.""I feel ashamed of using cloth,"" Janani told DW. ""If we miss school because of this, they won't teach us again the lessons we've missed, will they?""A survey conducted by DW of more than 500 girls across six schools in Sri Lanka's Central Province indicated that nearly half — 46% — struggled to afford pads each month, with the figure skyrocketing to 81% at one school.Janani's mother works as a tea plucker in the hills of Nuwara Eliya District and earns about 1,350 rupees (around €4 or $4.5) per day. She buys her daughter pads when she can afford it. When she has no pads, Janani said, she wonders ""why I get my period at all.""Almost half of the girls surveyed by DW said they missed school during their period for a myriad of reasons, including excessive pain. And it is affecting their school performance.""I keep thinking about it, and so I can't study,"" said 14-year-old Girija referring to period poverty , a sentiment echoed by some of her peers.Sri Lanka's government is making an effort to address the problem as its economy inches towards recovery following an economic collapse in 2022.The cost of a pack of 10 sanitary napkins increased by 92% after the economic crisis, from 140 to 270 rupees, according to the Advocata Institute. Imported sanitary pads continue to be taxed in Sri Lanka at 51%.Teacher Anthonyraj Devaneshi told DW that her school gave out one sanitary pad to girls in emergency situations, but could not afford to give them out consistently.""Some teachers will buy pads for us, but others won't,"" said 12-year-old Harini, adding that she found it awkward to ask and would usually ask her friends to do it on her behalf. ""If my friends aren't at school [when I get my period], I'll just come home.""Harini has to make the long journey home by herself if her parents are unable to pick her up — a walk which takes her an hour through the hills.Her school also has no place for girls to dispose of their sanitary pads, with several girls telling DW they avoided changing at school. Two schools had a policy requiring students who took a pad from school to purchase a replacement and hand it in the next day.A 2021 study by Advocata revealed that half of Sri Lankan women did not spend any money on sanitary products.Rashmira Balasuriya, director of the Arka Initiative to combat period poverty and technical advisor to Sri Lanka's Family Planning Association, said the issue had ""most likely gotten worse"" following the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis.To save money, many girls use cloth. About 44% of the girls surveyed by DW reported using a combination of cloth and pads or exclusively cloth during their period, although not all of them cited unaffordability as the reason.Balasuriya said the lack of sunlight in Sri Lanka's hill country meant cloth pads were not always safe to use, because they would not properly dry.Girija told DW she had started using pads after developing an infection from cloth. ""Using cloth is hard. It feels like it's not secure,"" she said. ""I feel scared to sit because I'm worried something might happen. It's hard to walk, to sit, or to sleep.""At least a dozen other girls told DW they had also developed infections from using cloth.Girija said her family took out loans from the store to buy pads and she felt angry with her mother when they could not afford them. However, her mother told her, ""It doesn't matter if we have to use cloth, you use pads."" Still, Girija only changes her pad only once every seven hours, afraid of running out.""When we use cloth for too long, sometimes it burns,"" said 13-year-old Saraswathi, who sometimes uses cloth pads even at school, although she avoids changing for the entire day. ""It's difficult to walk with cloth, and my hips hurt.""Teacher Thiruchelvam Mangala Roobini said there was also a lack of awareness around menstruation, with many girls who lacked pads forced to bleed through their underwear, which they would then dispose of in the toilets.Last year, the Sri Lankan government distributed two vouchers of 600 rupees each to 800,000 schoolgirls, with the last disbursement given in September 2024. The goal of the scheme was to allow the girls to buy sanitary pads.But Balasuriya said the voucher system was ""not a sustainable one,"" as the average woman needs about 20 pads over five days in a single month, and the money was simply insufficient. Some girls told DW the pads they purchased had run out in one or two months.Roobini believes that many girls did not purchase sanitary pads with the vouchers, citing previous instances where shoe vouchers provided by the government had been used to purchase other necessities.One school principal told DW he was ""100% sure"" that the sanitary pad voucher had even been used to purchase alcohol.The current government, led by Anura Kumara Dissanayake, announced in March that it would spend 1.44 billion rupees on a similar initiative, distributing two vouchers of 720 rupees each to all menstruating schoolgirls.A representative from the Department of Education told DW the initiative would begin again at the end of May, but it was not possible to say whether it would continue after the two sets of voucher disbursements. The lawmakers have yet to decide on the issue.""If they give us pads continuously, it'll be good,"" 14-year-old Girija told DW. ""Then they won't run out, right? We can keep using them.""","Nearly half of Sri Lankan girls struggle to afford sanitary pads each month. The cost of a pack of 10 sanitary napkins increased by 92% after the economic crisis.

Salt of the earth: Pilot project helping reclaim Sri Lankan farms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/salt-of-the-earth-pilot-project-helping-reclaim-sri-lankan-farms/articleshow/121176156.cms,"AP file photo

Yields under threat

Seeping salt



Resistant varieties







Katukurunda: A commando in an elite Sri Lankan police unit, Sameera Dilshan has an unusual mission, to reclaim farms poisoned by salt, a long-standing problem now accelerating due to climate change.Increasing salinity is slowly and steadily swallowing traditional rice paddies along the island's coastline, taking away the livelihood of generations of farmers.Two hours' drive south of the capital Colombo lies Katukurunda, one of the camps of the formidable Special Task Force (STF), created four decades ago to fight Tamil rebels.While his colleagues train for riot control under the humid heat of the nearby Indian Ocean, the 35-year-old non-commissioned officer and his ""commando-farmer"" team are hoeing, weeding and watering.Their goal? To grow coconut palms and a wide variety of fruits and vegetables in a paddy declared dead 40 years ago due to salt water contamination.""This plantation was launched in 2022 as part of a government initiative to improve food security,"" Dilshan said, with local authorities allocating land parcels.The method, known as sorjan, is similar to techniques used in Thailand and Indonesia.It reshapes flood-prone land by digging ponds where rice can be grown or fish raised, with more saline-tolerant coconut trees planted.Embankments around these ponds are used for more delicate crops.""We're tending to 360 coconut trees planted here... along with pumpkins, gourds and cucumbers,"" Dilshan said. ""In two and a half years, we'll know if it's a success or not.""""It's an efficient and climate-resilient production system that optimises land use and productivity, and increases farmers' profits,"" said Buddhi Marambe, from the University of Peradeniya.The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said in a 2024 report that saltwater from seas and oceans affects 10.7 percent of the Earth's land, making it uncultivable in some cases.It travels up rivers with the tides, seeps into soil through evaporation, and contaminates groundwater used for irrigation.Climate change, which dries out the soil, reduces water resources, or raises sea levels, is expected to increase the proportion of such ""salty"" land from 24 percent to 32 percent of the world's surface area by the end of the century, the FAO predicts.These trends ""threaten agricultural productivity and reduce crop yields in affected zones"", it warns.Sri Lanka is no exception.Marambe estimates that 223,000 hectares (551,000 acres), half of which are rice paddies, are impacted by salinity -- nearly eight percent of the country's total arable land.South of the pilot plantation lies the village of Parappuwa, surrounded by abandoned land.Here, just a few kilometres from the sea, only a few small areas of the paddy fields are still in use.""Everything is polluted by salt that comes up during high tide,"" said Gamini Piyal Wijesinghe, 46, a farmer's son who, after he left the army, went into the restaurant business instead.He pointed to a stream where 18 small dams were built to stop the seawater.""They weren't constructed properly,"" he said. ""The water seeps through.""Other former rice farmers have turned to cinnamon or rubber cultivation.""Cinnamon is doing fairly well, but our income has significantly dropped since we stopped growing rice,"" said W.D. Jayaratne, 50, head of the local farmers' association.The future is gloomy.""Salinity in the water is increasing and threatening our farmland,"" he added. ""There are also insects. Everywhere you look, there are problems.""In this district of Kalutara, local authorities are offering abandoned land to farmers to bring it back under cultivation, mostly with coconut trees.""We've already allocated 400 hectares and plan to increase that to 1,000 in the next two years,"" said district chief Janaka Gunawardana.""There's high demand for coconut. It will create income for our people.""In Katukurunda, Aruna Priyankara Perera, 55, was encouraged by the success of the STF farming experiment.""I got five acres (two hectares) next to my hotel to replicate the STF's project,"" he said in front of his freshly planted coconut and pumpkin field.""The land is free for two years, provided you can show it's being cultivated.""Rice, the local staple, is a top concern for the authorities.""Soil salinity is a major issue in Sri Lanka,"" Marambe said. ""We've successfully tested several promising rice varieties that are resistant to salinity and flooding.""The stakes are high.A recent study of the Bentota river estuary, in the island's southwest, found that half of local rice farmers had lost all their income due to saltwater contamination.Even more serious, Sri Lanka's food security is now under threat. The last rice harvest, from September to March, was the country's lowest since 2019.""If we don't all roll up our sleeves to bring salt-polluted land back into cultivation and production,"" Marambe said, ""the future will only get darker.""",Sri Lankan commando-farmer team aims to reclaim rice paddies poisoned by salt.

Funerals held in Myanmar for pupils and teachers killed in airstrike on school,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/funerals-held-in-myanmar-for-pupils-and-teachers-killed-in-airstrike-on-school/articleshow/121163870.cms,"Funerals held in Myanmar for pupils and teachers killed in airstrike on school (Photo: AP)





Funerals have been held in Myanmar for almost two dozen students and teachers alleged to have been killed in an airstrike on a local school by a ruling military jet fighter.Local resistance groups and independent media said Tuesday that 20 pupils and 2 teachers died in the attack on Ohe Htein Twin village, in Sagaing region's township of Tabayin, also known as Depayin. Their reports said that as many as 100 people were wounded.The dead students were from grades 2 to 11, with the youngest seven years old, according to the shadow National Unity Government, which serves as an umbrella organization for opponents of military ruleA member of a local resistance group fighting against army rule told The Associated Press that another student, who was severely injured in Monday's bombing, died Tuesday afternoon while undergoing medical treatment.The resistance fighter, who requested that neither he nor his group be named for fear of arrest by the military, said the incident occurred while more than 100 students were studying in a school in the village, which has about 500 houses. He denied that any resistance fighters were stationed in the village that was attacked.Sagaing has been a stronghold of armed resistance to army rule in Myanmar, and the military in recent years has stepped up airstrikes in their fight against resistance forces, which include the armed People's Defense Forces.The resistance has no effective defense against air attacks, which many reports say hit non-military targets.Myanmar has been in turmoil since the army's 2021 takeover ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, which led to nationwide peaceful protests that escalated into a durable armed resistance denying the army control of much of the country.A report Tuesday in the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper denied the army had carried out the airstrike, saying malicious media outlets were intentionally spreading fake information. The military's tight control over the media and the relative remoteness of many such incidents makes independent confirmation of what occurred difficult.The bodies of 18 of the victims, most of them under the age of 10 were buried Monday in two village cemeteries after hastily arranged funerals just a few hours after the bombing incident, the unidentified resistance fighter said.About 100 wounded people, both students and teachers, were being treated in regional hospitals as the village's clinic lacked adequate facilities. At least two victims have had to have limbs amputated, he added.A member of another resistance group, the White Depeyin People's Defence Force, also speaking on condition of anonymity, told the AP that the funerals concluded on Tuesday.A report on Tuesday by the human rights ministry of the national unity government said the jet fighter took off from an airbase in Meiktila township in the central region of Mandalay on Monday morning and deliberately attacked the school with two cluster bombs while students were preparing to sit for their exams.""All individuals implicated in the commanding, execution, or collusion of deliberate air strikes against innocent children, students, and educators shall be subject to stringent judicial repercussions,"" the group said in a separate statement. ""No avenue for impunity shall be permitted. Every responsible party will be pursued without respite, unequivocally identified, held accountable and subjected to stringent punitive measures under the full force of the law. ""The military has increasingly used airstrikes to counter the widespread armed struggle against its rule. More than 6,600 civilians are estimated to have been killed by security forces since the army's 2021 takeover, according to figures compiled by nongovernmental organizations.Airstrikes in Myanmar garnered increased attention recently when numerous reports deemed credible by the United Nations and human rights groups said that they continued to be carried out in the wake of Myanmar's devastating March 28 earthquake, after which the military and resistance groups declared ceasefires to facilitate relief efforts.""We are horrified by reports of a Myanmar regime airstrike on a school in an earthquake-affected area at a time when a ceasefire has been announced. Schools are meant to be a place of safety and opportunity, not collateral in a conflict,"" Britain's minister for Indo-Pacific catherine west said in a statement.""We repeat our call to all parties, particularly the Myanmar military, to refrain from airstrikes, safeguard civilians, and protect civilian infrastructure.""","Local resistance groups and independent media said 20 pupils and 2 teachers died in the attack. Their reports said that as many as 100 people were wounded. The dead students were from grades 2 to 11, with the youngest seven years old.

Nine months after the dramatic toppling of the Sheikh Hasina government in a student-led uprising , former Bangladesh President Abdul Hamid has quietly fled the country, reportedly donning a lungi and wheeled through the airport in a wheelchair in the dead of night.According to Dhaka Post, Hamid boarded a Thai Airways flight at 3:05 am Thursday, accompanied by his wife, brother, and brother-in-law. The image of the once-powerful President leaving in a humble lungi has gone viral, captured by a security camera and now emblematic of the fall of the Awami League.Hamid, who served two terms as President, is reportedly facing a murder charge. But unlike many top Awami League leaders who were arrested at airports or while crossing borders, he appears to have been allowed to leave the country unimpeded.“According to Articles 34 and 102 of the Constitution, no Bangladeshi citizen can be prevented from travelling unless there is a specific ban from the court. We have not received any instructions to ban him. There was no request or application from the police to detain or arrest him in any case,” an airport official told Dhaka Post.Since Sheikh Hasina fled to India following the August 5 uprising, several senior Awami League figures have either been jailed or disappeared. The new interim government is being led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus Hamid has not been seen in public since the transition.Meanwhile, a political counter-wave is building. Former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia returned to Dhaka last week after medical treatment in London. Her return turned into a massive street rally as thousands of BNP supporters lined the roads from the airport to her residence in Gulshan. She was accompanied by her daughters-in-law and flown home on a special plane sent by Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.Zia’s son Tarique Rahman, who has been living in London for 17 years due to numerous cases filed during Hasina's rule, now leads the BNP from abroad.","Abdul Hamid left the country on Thursday, nine months after the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

State threats







LONDON: Three Iranian nationals have appeared in court in London charged with suspected espionage for Iran's intelligence services, UK police said, as the government vowed to boost national security powers.The charges come amid heightened concerns about Iranian activities on UK soil.Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said following the charges that ""Iran must be held to account for its actions"".""We must also strengthen our powers to protect our national security as we will not tolerate growing state threats on our soil,"" she said.The three were all remanded in custody following a hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court in central London.They were arrested on May 3 in what the capital's Metropolitan police called ""a very complex and fast-moving investigation"", and were due to appear in a London court later on Saturday.They were named as Mostafa Sepahvand, 39, Farhad Javadi Manesh, 44, and Shapoor Qalehali Khani Noori, 55, all with addresses in London.The alleged spying activity took place from August 2024 to February 2025, according to police who confirmed that Iran was the country.""These are extremely serious charges under the National Security Act, which have come about following what has been a very complex and fast-moving investigation,"" said Dominic Murphy, head of the Met's Counter-Terrorism command.""Since the men were arrested two weeks ago, detectives have been working around the clock,"" he added.All three were charged with ""engaging in conduct likely to assist a foreign intelligence service between 14 August 2024 and 16 February 2025,"" the police said.""The foreign state to which the charges relate is Iran,"" the police said in their statement.Sepahvand was also charged with ""surveillance, reconnaissance and open-source research... intending to commit acts, namely serious violence against a person in the United Kingdom.""Manesh and Noori were also charged with ""surveillance and reconnaissance with the intention that acts, namely serious violence against a person in the United Kingdom, would be committed by others.""A fourth man was arrested on May 9 as part of the investigation, but has now been released without charge, the police added in their statement.The National Security Act gives law enforcement greater powers to disrupt ""state threats"" including foreign interference and espionage.In March, Iran became the first country to be placed on an enhanced tier of the Foreign Influence Registration Scheme (FIRS), which aims to boost the UK's national security against covert foreign influences.The measures, due to come into place later this year, will mean that all people working inside the UK for Iran, its intelligence services or the Revolutionary Guard would have to register or face jail.Five Iranian nationals were also arrested on May 3 in connection with an entirely separate investigation, with four of them remaining in custody after warrants of further detention were secured.The four were arrested on suspicion of preparation of a terrorist act, contrary to section five of the Terrorism Act 2006.A fifth was bailed to an unspecified date in May.","Three Iranian nationals have appeared in court in London charged with suspected espionage for Iran's intelligence services.

Billionaires in retreat





King Charles III and former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have found themselves side by side, not in politics, but in pounds. Both are now worth an estimated £640 million, earning them the 238th spot on the 2025 Sunday Times Rich List , released Friday.The list, which tracks Britain’s 350 wealthiest individuals and families, reveals a dramatic reshuffling at the top, and signs of financial turbulence rippling through the elite.At 76, King Charles climbed 20 spots from last year, buoyed in part by surging profits from Crown Estate wind farm deals, which doubled returns and boosted the sovereign grant that funds royal activities. Still, most royal assets, including Buckingham Palace, remain off the books as they’re owned “in the right of the Crown,” not personally. His private wealth includes the Balmoral and Sandringham estates, along with an investment portfolio inherited from Queen Elizabeth II.Meanwhile, Sunak’s political exit hasn’t dented his bank balance too much. The former PM has taken up a part-time role at Stanford University and joined the lucrative Washington Speakers Bureau. His wife, Akshata Murty, continues to draw dividends from Infosys, £7.5 million last year, though the tech stock’s recent slide shaved off some value.Despite this, the couple’s fortunes rose just enough to push them up from last year’s 245th place.The Hinduja family holds the crown at the top for a fourth straight year, with an estimated £35.3 billion, even after a £2 billion dip. They’re followed by another Indian-born duo, David and Simon Reuben, who climbed to No. 2 with £26.87 billion.Lakshmi Mittal, the steel magnate behind ArcelorMittal, remains at No. 8 with £15.44 billion, while Anil Agarwal of Vedanta Resources sits at No. 25 with £7.5 billion. Also on the list: Prakash Lohia (No. 31, £6.02 bn), Mohsin and Zuber Issa of Asda and EG Group (No. 32, £6 bn), and Navin and Varsha Engineer (No. 48, £3.45 bn).

Author Salman Rushdie attacker sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2022 stabbing case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/author-salman-rushdie-attacker-sentenced-to-25-years-in-prison-in-2022-stabbing-case/articleshow/121216239.cms,"



The man who stabbed acclaimed author Salman Rushdie on stage during a 2022 lecture in western New York has been sentenced to 25 years in prison. Hadi Matar , 27, was convicted in February of attempted murder and assault after attacking Rushdie as he prepared to speak at the Chautauqua Institution The brutal assault left Rushdie, 77, blind in one eye and seriously injured. He was stabbed over a dozen times in the head and torso. Matar also wounded another man on stage. Though Rushdie did not attend Friday’s sentencing, he submitted a victim impact statement. He had previously testified, recounting the harrowing moment he believed he was going to die.Before sentencing, Matar made a brief statement criticizing Rushdie and invoking free speech, calling the author a “hypocrite.” He received the maximum penalty: 25 years for the attack on Rushdie and seven years for injuring the other victim. The sentences will run concurrently, as both injuries occurred during the same incident, said Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt.Schmidt argued that Matar had deliberately planned the attack to cause maximum harm — not just to Rushdie, but to the audience of over 1,400 people present.Defense attorney Nathaniel Barone countered that Matar had no prior criminal record and suggested a lighter sentence of 12 years, arguing the audience members were not direct victims.Rushdie spent nearly five weeks in hospitals and rehabilitation centers following the attack. He later detailed his recovery in his 2024 memoir, Knife.Matar, a U.S. citizen from New Jersey, is also facing a federal trial on terrorism charges. Prosecutors say the stabbing was an attempt to carry out a decades-old fatwa issued in 1989 by Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini after the publication of Rushdie’s controversial novel, The Satanic Verses. The fatwa, which called for Rushdie’s death, was condemned internationally, though Iran later said it would no longer enforce it.According to prosecutors, Matar believed the edict was still valid and claimed it had been reaffirmed by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in 2006. Matar has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of providing material support to terrorists and committing terrorism that crosses national boundaries.Video evidence shown during the state trial captured the moment of the attack. Matar is seen approaching Rushdie from behind and stabbing him repeatedly as the audience screamed. The two struggled on stage before being separated by onlookers.Jurors reached their guilty verdict after less than two hours of deliberation.","Hadi Matar, 27, was convicted in February of attempted murder and assault after attacking Rushdie as he prepared to speak at the Chautauqua Institution.

The New Labour Doctrine: Technocratic Populism

Risks and Pushback

Final Word: A New Track, But the Same Band







For the better part of a decade, the UK’s Labour Party had perfected the art of losing.Despite Brexit chaos, five Tory prime ministers, Boris Johnson’s Downing Street circus, Liz Truss ’s lettuce-inflicted collapse, a pandemic, and a brutal cost-of-living crisis, Labour remained stuck in opposition—haunted by its own ideological baggage and public mistrust. Voters flirted with them, but never committed. In fact, by the time the adult in the room (read: Rishi Sunak) took the helm, the British voters were fed up with the torrid Tories.Under Keir Starmer , Labour stormed back into power with 412 seats, ending 14 years of Conservative rule and delivering the party its most decisive mandate since Tony Blair. Starmer entered Downing Street promising “national renewal.”And ten months later, that renewal has a soundtrack.Once content to hum along to the liberal chorus of inclusivity and open borders, Labour under Starmer has flipped the record. If the party’s earlier stance on immigration echoed the hopeful tones of Led Zeppelin’s Immigrant Song—a rallying cry for arrival and adventure—Starmer has turned down the volume and remixed the track. The tone is no longer about crossing oceans. It’s about drawing lines.Nowhere is that clearer than in immigration, the policy area undergoing perhaps the most dramatic transformation of Starmer’s premiership.Gone is Labour’s open-armed approach. In its place: a tougher, technocratic, and unapologetically control-oriented stance that has redrawn the political centre ground. Starmer’s pivot on immigration isn’t just a shift—it’s a strategic reset of Labour’s governing DNA.In a blistering departure from the past, Starmer’s government has unveiled a sweeping overhaul of the UK’s immigration system—signalling a new era of pragmatism over idealism.His administration’s white paper, released in May 2025, laid out the most comprehensive set of immigration reforms in over a decade. Key features include:The closure of the overseas care worker visa route, despite warnings from the social care sector about staffing shortages. Graduate route visas shortened from two years to 18 months, signalling a clampdown on education-to-immigration pipelines. Employer penalties for sponsors who fail to ensure their visa holders comply with immigration rules.Each policy is calibrated to lower net migration, raise entry standards, and reduce dependency on foreign workers—without the theatrics often associated with right-wing immigration crackdowns. Starmer, once a cautious voice on the issue, is now crystal clear: control is back at the heart of UK immigration policy.Unlike his predecessors, Starmer isn’t relying solely on domestic tightening. He’s aggressively pursuing bilateral returns agreements—most prominently with Albania, a key transit point for irregular migration to the UK. This isn’t abstract diplomacy. The results are being posted—literally. Starmer’s own social media feed touts numbers:Labour governments of the past tiptoed around such figures. Starmer leads with them.The message is unmistakable: Labour is no longer the party of soft borders. It is the party of competent enforcement.Perhaps the most symbolic reform in the white paper is the expansion of English language requirements.Skilled migrants are now expected to speak fluent English. Adult dependents—often excluded from integration policy—are now required to meet basic linguistic benchmarks.Starmer has framed this not as exclusion, but as national cohesion.It’s a politically deft move. By focusing on language, Labour communicates a clear, values-based vision of integration—one that appeals across class and party lines.Labour’s pivot isn’t occurring in a vacuum. The political right, now fragmented between the remnants of the Conservatives and Farage-linked Reform UK, continues to press immigration as a defining issue. Nigel Farage , never one to miss a populist wave, has tried to frame Labour’s pivot as a political theft—but in truth, Starmer has simply executed what Farage only ever ranted about.Rather than ceding that ground, Starmer has planted a flag in it. His rhetoric—“take back control,” “deterrence at source,” “secure our borders”—could comfortably fit into a Conservative press release. But under Starmer, those slogans come with spreadsheets and statecraft, not slogans and scapegoats.What makes Starmer’s pivot effective isn’t just the toughness—it’s the tone. Where Boris Johnson offered theatre and Suella Braverman brought ideological warfare, Starmer offers cold clarity. He isn’t trying to rile the base. He’s trying to reassure the majority. That line—“further and faster”—has become the defining rhythm of Starmer’s government. It’s not a slogan. It’s a mission tempo.None of this is without friction.Trade unions and care sector leaders have criticised the loss of overseas recruitment channels. Universities fear a chilling effect on foreign student enrolments. Civil liberties groups have warned of the long-term consequences of hardening language tests and residency pathways.But crucially, there has been no internal revolt. Labour MPs may grumble in private, but few dare publicly challenge the Prime Minister’s line. Starmer holds the whip hand—and the voter trust.A party once paralysed by factionalism is now united under one doctrine: delivery over debate.Keir Starmer hasn’t just shifted Labour’s tone on immigration. He’s composed a new track entirely—tighter, sharper, less forgiving, more focused.If the party once played to the rhythm of globalism and open-door optimism, Starmer now conducts with statecraft and structure. The Immigrant Song may still be on the national playlist—but this version plays in a different key.This isn’t a betrayal of Labour’s soul. It’s an adaptation of its sound. A band playing to a different crowd—without skipping a beat.That’s not just a promise. It’s a tempo.And Keir Starmer is keeping time.","UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has unveiled a sweeping overhaul of the UK’s immigration system. New policy is calibrated to lower net migration, raise entry standards, and reduce dependency on foreign workers.

LONDON: The superyacht of British tech magnate Mike Lynch, which capsized last August off the coast of Sicily at the cost of seven lives, was knocked over by "" extreme wind "" and could not recover, British investigators said Thursday.Billionaire entrepreneur Lynch, 59, and his daughter Hannah, 18, were among the dead when the 56-meter (184 feet) Bayesian sank Aug. 19 last year. The boat trip was a celebration of Lynch's acquittal in a fraud case in the US in June.In an interim report on the disaster, Britain's Marine Accident Investigation Branch said the boat was ""vulnerable"" to winds that were even lighter than the ones that tipped it over. The report was based on ""a limited amount of verified evidence"" as a criminal investigation by Italian authorities has restricted its access to the wreck and other pieces of evidence, it said.The agency, which is investigating the disaster because the Bayesian was registered in the U.K, said the ""vulnerabilities"" were ""unknown to either the owner or the crew,"" as they were not included in the stability information book carried on board.The report stated that the Bayesian was sailed to the site where it sank the day before in order to ""shelter"" from forecast thunderstorms. It said the disaster occurred at 4:06 a.m. local time, when wind speeds exceeded 70 knots (81 mph.), ""violently"" knocking the vessel over to a 90-degree angle in under 15 seconds,It said that at the time of the incident, the vessel was in a ""motoring condition"" with its sails lowered, while the centerboard, which is used to help stabilize it, was in a ""raised"" position.""You have the wind pushing the vessel over and then you have the stability of the vessel trying to push the vessel back up right again,"" said Simon Graves, an MAIB investigator. ""And what our studies found was that they show that the Bayesian may have been vulnerable to high winds and that these winds were likely to have been evident at the time of the accident.""Inquest proceedings in the UK are looking at the deaths of Lynch and his daughter, as well as Morgan Stanley International bank chairman Jonathan Bloomer, 70, and his wife, Judy Bloomer, 71, who were all British nationals.The others who died in the sinking were US lawyer Chris Morvillo and his wife Neda Morvillo, and Canadian-Antiguan national Recaldo Thomas, who was working as a chef on the vessel.Fifteen people, including Lynch's wife, Angela Bacares, were rescued.A project to move the Bayesian into an upright position and lift it to the surface has been paused since May 9 when a diver died during underwater work. Recovery work is set to resume from Thursday.Further details such as ""escape routes"" will be included in the final report, according to Graves.""Once we get access to the vessel we'll be able to tell a fuller picture of activities on board and the sequence of events,"" he said.No date has been set for when the final report will be published.","Billionaire entrepreneur Mike Lynch, 59, and his daughter Hannah, 18, were among the dead when the Bayesian sank.

The British economy grew at its fastest rate in a year during the first quarter of 2025, official figures showed Thursday, in a welcome boost to the Labour government, which has made lifting the country's growth its top priority.The Office for National Statistics said growth, as measured by gross domestic product, increased by 0.7 per cent in the first quarter of the year from the final three months of 2024, with the country's dominant services sector doing particularly well.The first quarter increase makes the British economy the fastest-growing among the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.Growth was modestly ahead of market expectations for a 0.6 per cent increase. It was also the biggest increase since the first quarter of 2024, when the economy expanded by 0.9 per cent.Treasury chief Rachel Reeves welcomed the growth leap, and said the figures showed the choices made by Labour since it was elected last July were beginning to pay off.""We're set to be the fastest growing economy in the G-7 in the first three months of this year and that's incredibly welcome, but I know that there is more to do,"" she said while on a visit to a Rolls-Royce factory in Derby, northern England.Most economists think is likely to slow down in the second quarter of the year, partly because of the global uncertainty generated by US President Donald Trump's tariff policies.Though most tariffs were paused for 90 days following the ensuing market turmoil, including the 10 per cent baseline tariff applied to UK goods entering the US, the backdrop for the global economy remains highly uncertain, particularly if the US-China trade war persists.Some of that uncertainty, with regard to the British economy, lifted Thursday when both Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer separately outlined details of a trade deal between the US and the UK Though Trump kept the 10 per cent baseline tariffs on UK, he agreed to reduce the levies on British autos, steel and aluminum.Sanjay Raja, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said the growth uptick will likely be short-lived, especially during the second quarter when trade uncertainty will be at its peak.""Exporters will likely see reduced demand as well from higher US tariffs and weaker global demand,"" he said.Economists said growth will likely falter in the second quarter as new taxes on business were imposed in April. Also a raft of price rises during the month, including domestic energy and water bills, are expected to keep a lid on consumer demand.",UK economy grew at its fastest rate in a year during the first quarter of 2025.

Poll Do you believe Bella May Culley was unfairly targeted in this incident? Yes, she was a victim of circumstance. No, she made a poor choice.

Teen 'smuggler's social media brags before nightmare arrest after Thai holiday





An 18-year-old British woman from Billingham , Teesside, is facing a potential life sentence in Georgia after she was arrested for allegedly trying to smuggle 14kg (30lbs) of cannabis into the country. Bella May Culley , who had recently travelled to south-east Asia, vanished in Thailand before reappearing in handcuffs in Tbilisi.Georgian authorities claim Culley was detained at Tbilisi International Airport on Saturday last week, following a sting operation by the Special Tasks Department.According to Georgian Police, officers discovered 34 vacuum-sealed bags of marijuana and 20 packets of hashish in her luggage. As per the BBC, she has been charged with illegally purchasing, possessing, and importing a particularly large amount of narcotics, crimes that carry up to 20 years or even life imprisonment under Georgian law.Culley remained silent during a court appearance in Tbilisi, only revealing she was pregnant.The court has ordered a medical examination to verify the claim and remanded her in custody at Tbilisi’s only female prison, which, as noted by Human Rights Watch , has previously been condemned as “inhuman” and “degrading”.According to the Daily Mail, her grandfather, William Culley, 80, said the family is distraught and in disbelief. “She’s not an international drug trafficker.She’s just a student who wanted to go on holiday. Someone must have taken advantage of her”, she said.Bella’s father, Neil Culley, who lives in Vietnam, is now in Georgia to support his daughter.Her disappearance had initially sparked an international search when her family lost contact with her on May 10 after she had travelled to Thailand. Her mother, Lyanne Kennedy, was quoted by The Sun as saying that she was shocked to hear about the charges, insisting Bella “doesn’t like the party lifestyle” and had travelled to reconnect with friends from a previous trip.Before her arrest, Culley had shared clips on TikTok showing off stacks of cash and referring to a “Bonnie and Clyde” lifestyle.In one video, she posed with the caption, “Blonde or brunette? Erm how about we get up to criminal activities side by side like Bonnie n Clyde”, comments now drawing scrutiny.As per The Sun, her online activity stopped abruptly on May 9.Bella had completed an access course at Middlesbrough College and hoped to pursue nursing.Her lawyer, Ia Todua, was quoted by the BBC as saying that the teenager appeared too anxious to testify. “She is so clenched. She’s a child, in my opinion… she chose to remain silent”, she added.","Bella May Culley, 18, from Billingham, Teesside, was arrested in Tbilisi, Georgia.

Poll Should Prime Minister Keir Starmer prioritize stronger relations with the EU despite domestic pressures? Yes, he should be bolder. No, he should focus on domestic issues.

Left-wing vote:





Prime Minister Keir Starmer is treading a fine line on UK-EU relations as hard-right populists make gains at a time when Brexit and immigration remain toxic issues in Britain.The Labour leader will host European Union chiefs in London on Monday for a major summit designed to progress a deeper relationship between the UK and the bloc than the one negotiated by the previous Conservative government.But Starmer will be wary of giving ammunition to arch-Eurosceptic Nigel Farage's Reform UK party , while also conscious that US President Donald Trump views the EU negatively.""He's walking two tightropes at the same time,"" said British foreign policy expert Richard Whitman, describing immigration as a ""salient"" issue in the UK and Trump's attitude to the EU as ""hostile"".""Starmer is balancing this big international issue and also the domestic politics one, and that's what makes it so tricky for the prime minister,"" the politics professor told AFP.The anti-immigration Reform was founded in 2018 -- two years after Britons voted to leave the EU -- as the Brexit Party, with the aim of advocating for Britain to depart the bloc without a withdrawal agreement.Renamed the Reform UK Party in 2021, it has gained significant ground.Last month, it won more than 670 local council seats, its first two mayoral posts, and gained an additional parliamentary MP in local English elections.Farage's upstarts are also leading national opinion polls as they tap into concerns about net migration, which stood at 728,000 in the 12 months to last June, and the struggling economy.Starmer hopes closer relations with the bloc can spur his main ambition of economic growth but he has vowed to honour the Brexit result, not rejoin the single market, customs union or return to free movement of people.He has been publicly reticent about an EU-proposed youth mobility scheme that would allow British and European 18- to 30-year-olds to study and work in the UK and vice versa, although the UK government has made warmer noises in recent weeks about a possible controlled programme.An announcement seems unlikely on Monday given that it comes just a week after Starmer said he wanted to ""significantly"" reduce immigration in a speech intended to appeal to potential Reform voters.""To announce something like that would be a bit perilous politically,"" said Whitman, deputy director of the Global Europe Centre at the University of Kent.Starmer and EU bosses Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa are instead expected to seal a defence pact at the summit -- a deal seen as the lowest hanging fruit for negotiators.""There's nothing in his proposals that is a dial-shifter in terms of economic growth,"" said Anand Menon, director of the UK in a Changing Europe think-tank.While Starmer is squeezed on the right, he is also under pressure from pro-European lawmakers within Labour who want him to get closer to the EU.""We must not let Brexit hold us back from our national interest,"" Stella Creasy, chair of the Labour Movement for Europe group, told AFP.""Both sides must move on from the disagreements and red lines to seeking to reduce the paperwork and red tape we face as a result.""A poll for the internationalist think-tank Best for Britain last month found that 53 per cent of voters believe a closer relationship with the EU would be positive for the UK economy.Britain's traditional third party, the Liberal Democrats, wants to rejoin the single market and is also surging in popularity, as are the left-wing Greens as UK politics fractures.""I think Labour are underplaying the danger of losing votes to their left,"" said Menon.He thinks Starmer -- who voted to remain at the 2016 referendum -- can afford to be bolder considering his 156-majority in parliament and the fact that Reform only has five out of 650 MPs.""Everything is done in a sort of defensive crouch,"" Menon said of the prime minister's approach.""It's kind of apologetic, rather than, 'This is what I think is good for the country, this is why I'm doing it'.""I would advise him to start winning the argument.""",Prime Minister Keir Starmer is treading a fine line on UK-EU relations as hard- right populists make gains.

In a move to ease the pressure on Britain’s overflowing jails, justice secretary Shabana Mahmood has announced emergency measures allowing recalled prisoners to be released after just 28 days.This step is expected to free up 1,400 prison places, reports the Independent.Speaking on Wednesday, Mahmood warned that the prison system is at a crisis point, with jails now 99 per cent full and on course to completely run out of space within five months. “If our prisons overflow, courts cancel trials, police halt their arrests, crime goes unpunished and we reach a total breakdown of law and order,” she said.The emergency scheme will apply to offenders serving one to four-year sentences who are recalled for breaching their licence terms. However, those recalled for serious further offences , including certain sexual and violent crimes and serious domestic abuse, will be excluded.While announcing the early release plan, Mahmood also revealed £4.7 billion in Treasury funding for a ""record prison expansion"". This will support three new facilities. Existing prisons will also see additional cells added.However, Mahmood admitted that “we cannot build our way out of this crisis”, warning that the population is increasing by around 3,000 each year, enough to fill two prisons annually.Despite already releasing more than 16,000 inmates after just 40 per cent of their sentences, Mahmood said further action was essential to “buy us the time we need”.Amy Rees, the Ministry of Justice’s interim permanent secretary, said running prisons nearly full is dangerous. It causes more violence, less time for education and work, and forces the system to use emergency plans. Rees warned that the justice system could break down. Police might not be able to arrest people, and courts could be forced to let dangerous offenders go on bail.","Shabana Mahmood announces emergency measures to ease pressure on jails.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told lawmakers Wednesday that recent arson attacks on properties linked to him represent ""an attack on all of us, on democracy and the values that we stand for.""The remarks by Starmer during weekly prime minister's questions were his first since the fires came to light earlier this week.The attacks were condemned by leaders across the House of Commons , including the Conservative Party's Kemi Badenoch, who described them as ""completely unacceptable.""On Tuesday, London's Metropolitan Police arrested a 21-year-old man in southeast London on suspicion of starting fires at Starmer's private house, another property and a car connected to the politician. No injuries were reported from any of the fires.In a statement Wednesday, police said they have been granted a further 36 hours to question the man, who is being held at a London police station. That means he can be questioned until Friday morning.Police said the suspect was detained on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life after an early morning fire Monday damaged the door of the house in Kentish Town, north London, where Starmer and his family lived before he was elected to lead the country last July. Starmer moved with his family to the prime minister's official Downing Street residence after taking office.Counterterrorism detectives, who are leading the investigation because it involves the prime minister, are also looking into connections between a car fire Thursday near Starmer's house and another fire Sunday outside a house nearby that has been converted into apartments and which he has a connection to.Authorities are investigating whether there was state involvement as well as looking at other potential motivations.""A key line of enquiry is whether the fires are linked due to the two premises and the vehicle all having previous links to the same high-profile public figure,"" said Cmdr Dominic Murphy, head of counterterrorism at the Metropolitan Police.Starmer's former house has attracted protesters in the past. Last year, three pro-Palestinian activists were arrested and charged with public order offenses after unfurling a banner covered in red handprints outside the building.","Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemns ""attack on our democracy"" after fires at homes linked to him.
