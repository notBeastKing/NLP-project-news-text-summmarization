US consumer sentiment falls for fifth month driven by inflation fears,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-consumer-sentiment-falls-for-fifth-month-amid-inflation-fears/articleshow/121217699.cms,"AI-generated image

Consumer sentiment in the United States fell for the fifth straight month in May, driven by growing concerns over inflation linked to President Donald Trump 's trade policies.According to preliminary data from the University of Michigan , the consumer sentiment index dropped by 2.7 per cent to 50.8- its lowest level since June 2022 and nearly 30 per cent below its January reading. The decline contradicts economists’ expectations of stabilization.The drop reflects rising anxiety over inflation, fueled by Trump’s aggressive tariff strategy. Although recent trade talks led to a reduction in US tariffs on Chinese goods, from 145 per cent to 30 per cent, current rates remain historically high. In return, China agreed to lower duties on US exports from 125 per cent to 10 per cent.People became more concerned about the escalating cost of living as inflation expectations surge. The Michigan survey found that consumers anticipate inflation to hit 7.3 per cent over the next year, the highest since 1981, up from 6.5 per cent last month. The five-year inflation outlook rose to 4.6 per cent- its highest since 1991.The Michigan survey, conducted from April 22 to May 13, only partially reflected the impact of the US-China tariff reductions announced on May 11.Meanwhile actual inflation fell to 2.3 per cent last month, a four-year low, thus, the Federal Reserve officials remain cautious. Persistent inflation expectations may delay any interest rate cuts, as they risk becoming self-fulfilling through wage demands and price hikes.Fed Chair Jerome Powell had previously called these consumer projections an “outlier,” but their steady climb may influence monetary policy decisions.","The consumer sentiment index dropped by 2.7 per cent to 50.8- its lowest level since June 2022.

'Will not be able to operate beyond FY26': Vodafone Idea's insolvency warning without government support on AGR dues,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/will-not-be-able-to-operate-beyond-fy26-vodafone-ideas-insolvency-warning-without-government-support-on-agr-dues/articleshow/121216831.cms,"Telecom operator Vodafone Idea Limited (short VIL, commonly called Vi)informed the Department of Telecommunications ( DoT ) that it will not be able to continue operations beyond FY26 without government support on adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues. The company said that ongoing discussions with banks for funding would stall in the absence of timely assistance.In a letter dated April 17, 2025, Vi CEO Akshaya Moondra wrote to the Telecom Secretary, stressing the urgency of intervention, according to PTI report on Friday. He said, ""Without GoI's (Government of India) timely support on AGR, VIL will not be able to operate beyond FY26 as the bank funding discussions will not move forward,"" adding that ""no support will lead to a point of no return.""Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has agreed to hear a fresh petition from Vodafone Idea seeking a waiver of approximately Rs 30,000 crore in AGR dues. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing the company, requested an urgent hearing before a bench comprising Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice Augustine George Masih. The hearing is scheduled for May 19.In its communication to the DoT, VIL warned that without the disbursement of bank debt, its planned investments would not materialise.The company said that operational improvements would halt and the funds raised over the past year would be exhausted, effectively bringing the capital expenditure cycle to a standstill. It stated, ""In such a case, the entire fund raising done over last 12 months and investment done so far by the company, as also the equity stake of government including the recent conversion, will lose value. ""The telecom company further hintedthat, in the absence of support and given its inability to meet AGR obligations, it could face insolvency proceedings under the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), potentially disrupting services and leading to the devaluation of its network and spectrum assets. The company estimated that around 200 million subscribers would be forced to port out if services were interrupted. It emphasised that timely support from the government would protect public interest and significantly benefit the Indian economy.The company said that such support would ensure continued service for about 200 million users, safeguard employment for approximately 30,000 individuals, and protect the investments of over 6 million shareholders. It noted that the government, as the largest stakeholder with a 49 per cent equity holding, stood to suffer substantial losses if Vodafone Idea became marginalised or ceased operations. It said, "". .. plus the value of GoI stake will be reduced to nil, in case no support is provided.""Vodafone Idea also reminded the government of its stated policy to maintain a three-player private telecom market. ""The government has always maintained that it supports a 3 private player market. In case the telecom sector is reduced to a duopoly, this will not only be a bad outcome for competition and consumer choice, but will also make future spectrum auctions, a constant source of revenue for the government, a non-starter,"" the company said.As part of its relief proposal, Vi urged the government to consider the principal demand as per DoT till FY19, amounting to Rs 17,213 crore, as final, and to provide a complete waiver on interest and penalties. The company noted that, after accounting for payments made in 2020 and the AGR dues converted into equity in 2023, the balance AGR dues as of March 2025 would be Rs 7,852 crore. It proposed that this amount be paid over a 20-year period, with no further accrual of interest. It also requested five additional years of moratorium until FY30, followed by 11 equal annual instalments of Rs 714 crore between FY31 and FY41.Additionally, itrequested support in spectrum-related payments. Vi sought a one-year extension of the spectrum payment period for spectrum acquired before the 2021 auction and a five-year moratorium on spectrum instalment payments from FY28 to FY32.","Telecom operator Vodafone Idea Limited (short VIL, commonly called Vi) informed the Department of Telecommunications ( DoT) that it will not be able to continue operations beyond FY26.

Novo Nordisk CEO to step down amid market challenges and stock plunge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/novo-nordisk-ceo-to-step-down-amid-market-challenges-and-stock-plunge/articleshow/121214675.cms,"Novo Nordisk outgoing CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen (Image credit: LinkedIn)

Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk , maker of popular weight-loss drug Ozempic , announced on Friday that CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen will step down, citing ongoing ""market challenges"" and a significant drop in the company’s share value.The board and Jorgensen reached a mutual decision to initiate a leadership transition. He will remain in his role temporarily to ""support a smooth transition to new leadership"", according to the company.“The changes are, however, made in light of the recent market challenges Novo Nordisk has been facing, and the development of the company’s share price since mid-2024,” the company said in a statement. The board and Jorgensen “have jointly concluded that initiating a CEO succession is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders,"" it added.The decision comes as Novo Nordisk grapples with a sharp decline in its stock price- down more than 50 per cent since June 2024. This was after the stock value had experienced a dramatic surge following the launch of both Wegovy and the diabetes medication Ozempic, with both products containing semaglutide as their primary active component.Then, sShares fell a further three per cent on the Copenhagen exchange following Friday's CEO exit announcement.The company recently downgraded its annual sales growth projection, adjusting the forecast from 16-24 per cent to 13-21 per cent. The revision is attributed to rising competition, particularly from compounded versions of its GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Ozempic, produced in American pharmacies during a recent supply shortage.However, the US regulators, even though had declared the shortage over in February and ordered an end to compounding, the impact continues to be felt. Novo Nordisk stated it is “actively focused on preventing unlawful and unsafe compounding.”The firm also faces increasing pressure from US rival Eli Lilly , whose weight-loss injection Zepbound is gaining traction in the same market. A research paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Sunday revealed that individuals achieved greater weight reduction whilst using Eli Lilly's rival medication Zepbound.Additionally, the announcement of successful clinical trials for Eli Lilly's diabetes and obesity medication orforglipron caused Novo Nordisk's share prices to decline significantly last month.Diabetes affects more than 10 percent of people globally, and treatments for this condition remain central to Novo Nordisk's pharmaceutical operations. The International Diabetes Federation projects a 46 percent rise in adult diabetes cases by 2045.Additionally, the World Obesity Federation anticipates that by 2035, obesity and overweight conditions will affect over 50 percent of global population, potentially resulting in annual economic consequences exceeding $4 trillion.","Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen will step down as CEO of Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk.

‘A good teacher will never leave students halfway…’: Byju's founder Raveendran on why he didn’t agree to shut down businesses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/a-good-teacher-will-never-leave-students-halfway-byjus-founder-raveendran-on-why-he-didnt-agree-to-shut-down-businesses/articleshow/121236402.cms,"CEO Byju Raveendran in interview with ANI

NEW DELHI: In his first extensive pubsince Byju's came under intense scrutiny, founder and CEO Byju Raveendran has laid out a renewed vision for the embattled ed-tech company- “Byju's 3.0”- with a sharp focus on returning to its roots: empowering teachers, prioritizing students as he explained on why he won't walk away from the business.“A good teacher will never leave students halfway,” he said in an interview with ANI., explaining why he resisted pressure to shut down operations when the company was facing its lowest point. “The teacher in me stood up, and we didn’t shut down the businesses. We had to complete the course.”Further referencing the legal troubles, Raveendran said, “We don’t belong in courtrooms, we belong in classrooms . That’s where we belong."" “And these classrooms, being based out of India, are our biggest advantage. It's a country where there is so much respect for teachers, so much respect for learning.”Once valued at $22 billion, Byju's has seenlegal troubles, funding issues, and investor disputes. A major flashpoint is the lawsuit involving Byju's Alpha, its US-based financing arm, which has accused Raveendran, his wife and co-founder Divya Gokulnath , and former executive Anita Kishore of diverting $533 million in loan funds.Raveendran denied the charges, calling them a conspiracy by Glas Trust, the lender’s trustee. “They are clearly telling there is no fraud, but they are trying to make it look like there is... The goal is to create a narrative that suits their interests.” He also claimed Glas is under investigation in India for bribery and FCPA violations.Byju’s had also failed to secure $700 million in committed funding- something Raveendran attributes to global economic shocks. “There was no litigation. We didn’t go and litigate those investors who backed out. And from then onwards, it’s almost now three years, we have been struggling for liquidity,” he said.Raveendran acknowledged mistakes during the company’s aggressive expansion, especially during the pandemic. “When we tried expanding from India to the whole world, we made some business mistakes . Maybe we could have taken it a little bit slowly,” he said, attributing the push to investor pressure. “We have 160 world-class investors. All of them–this was the mandate: grow, grow, grow and change the way kids learn.”Alleging that some US-based lenders and hedge funds sought to exploit the situation, Raveendran added, “I’m not blaming all our investors. But there are a few rotten apples... a couple of US-based lenders. They've made more money than anyone could have imagined from Byju's.”He also reflected on investor pressure to shut down operations amid mounting losses but said he refused to walk away. “Suddenly when all investors who were asking us grow, grow, grow, overnight they told that markets are changing, now cut and shut down businesses. I didn't agree for that. The teacher in me stood up and we didn't shut down the businesses. We had to complete the course,” he said.Raveendran also claimedthat teaching has always been a core passion for him and his wife. “I see that even today. My 78-year-old father, when any student asks him something then I can see his eyes lighting up. And that's true for me and for Divya. Teaching is one of the most satisfying jobs and that's where it's an unfinished dream for us.”Speaking about financial decisions that impacted the company, Raveendran admitted, “That was the only mistake. We shouldn’t have taken that term loan when we had enough equity options,"" he said referring to $1 billion loan in 2021.""We're not giving up. Byju's 3.0 will stay true to our original mission,"" he said and emphasised a more sustainable approach saying. ""I'm stubborn when it comes to the mission. It's going to be the same. How do we make it easy and interesting for students? How can we use AI not to replace teachers but to enable teachers to become better teachers,"" he remarked.Reflecting on the company’s journey, he said, “We built this company from the ground up, from 0 to 20 billion, from a handful of students to hundreds of millions. That is something nobody can take away from us.”“Why shouldn't I fight to protect what I've built over the last 20 years, what we've built together with 85,000 employees? When we make a comeback, it will be on the same mission- but we will be more flexible in how we operate. We've learned a lot of lessons along the way,"" he added.He also clarified the intent behind his commitment. “I never saw the money come. I never saw it go. We invested everything we had in one mission- Byju's. We've invested only in one place in only one mission. We have no other investments. My entire investment is in Byju's"".His wife Gokulnath, too, addressed speculation around the family’s lifestyle and wealth. “If I have a circle of 10 people, Byju has a circle of 5. We don't go out, we don't party, we don't network. For us, it's always been about the company and our family,” she said. “We don't own any luxury cars. We don't own any luxury homes… It's always been about what we can do for our country.”","CEO Byju Raveendran has laid out a renewed vision for the embattled ed-tech company- “Byju's 3.0” “We don’t belong in courtrooms, we belong in classrooms. That’s where we belong,"" he said. He also reflected on investor pressure to shut down operations amid mounting losses.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121238526,imgsize-566129,width-400,resizemode-4/121238526.jpg"

Gold prices are expected to fluctuate between $3,050 and $3,250 per ounce in the second quarter of 2025, according to a report by ICICI Bank Global Markets , while suggesting a short-term correction of declining prices.After rising nearly 25 per cent during January to April 2025, gold prices have declined around 4 per cent over the past fortnight. The pullback reflects easing concerns over global trade conflicts and reduced safe-haven demand, following the 90-day truce between the US and China.Data from the World Gold Council (WGC) highlights strong investment demand in the first quarter of 2025, with a 170 per cent year-on-year increase. This surge was largely driven by investor uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration’s policies and ongoing trade disputes. However, improving diplomatic ties have since tempered market concerns, contributing to the recent price moderation.The report also notes that the slowdown in central bank gold purchases appears to be temporary. Meanwhile, elevated prices have subdued jewellery demand, a trend likely to persist in the near term.“We would not rule out the prospect of a mild correction setting in place in the near term, particularly if the US is able to move forward with making trade deals with the rest of the world,” the report stated as quoted by news agency ANI.In the Indian market, MCX gold prices stood at Rs 92,480 per 10 grams on Saturday. Domestic prices have remained steady, mirroring global weakness and benefiting slightly from the appreciation of the Indian rupee against the US dollar.Gold imports have also moderated, with April imports at USD 3.1 billion compared to USD 4.5 billion in March. This decline aligns with reduced jewellery demand due to higher prices.Going forward, ICICI Bank expects Indian gold prices to maintain an upward trajectory, ranging between Rs 92,500 and Rs 94,500 per 10 grams in the second quarter of 2025, with potential to reach Rs 96,000 to Rs 98,000 per 10 grams in the latter half of the year.","Gold prices are expected to fluctuate between $3,050 and $3.250 per ounce in the second quarter of 2025.

India-UK free trade agreement set to boost bilateral trade by 15% annually: CareEdge report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-uk-free-trade-agreement-set-to-boost-bilateral-trade-by-15-annually-careedge-report/articleshow/121239126.cms,"The recently signed Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between India and the United Kingdom is expected to enhance bilateral trade, with projected annual growth of around 15 per cent until calendar year 2030, according to a report by credit rating and research agency CareEdge.India and the UK signed the FTA on May 6, 2025, concluding nearly three years of negotiations aimed at deepening economic cooperation. Under the terms of the agreement, India will reduce tariffs on 90 per cent of British goods, with 85 per cent becoming completely duty-free over a span of ten years. In return, the UK will eliminate tariffs on several Indian products, enabling 99 per cent of India’s exports to the UK to face zero duties.“Once the FTA is effective, the trade value between these two economies is expected to increase by around 15% annually until CY30, factoring in the aspect that the FTA will come into effect in a year,” CareEdge noted in its report as quoted news agency PTI.Currently, trade with the UK constitutes approximately 2 per cent of India’s total trade volume—a relatively modest figure considering the economic scale and potential of both nations.Despite this, bilateral trade has maintained a consistent upward trajectory over recent years, supported by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10–12 per cent.The report pointed out that trade volumes had dipped in 2020 and 2021 due to global headwinds, including the COVID-19 pandemic, Brexit-induced disruptions, and a broader global recession. However, the FTA is expected to reenergize trade by removing tariff barriers and simplifying cross-border business.CareEdge estimates that, with the FTA in place, India’s exports to the UK could reach approximately GBP 45 billion by 2030, while imports from the UK are projected to grow to GBP 30 billion over the same period.The report highlights several advantages for Indian exporters, including improved market access, more stable and reliable supply chains, enhanced competitiveness, and increased export volumes. It added, “The FTA is expected to boost India's exports by significantly reducing tariffs, easing trade barriers leading to improved market access and make Indian products more price competitive, thereby increasing their demand in the UK. ”Furthermore, the agreement comes as a relief for Indian exporters facing subdued sales and ongoing concerns over possible reciprocal tariffs from the United States.According to the agreement, 99 per cent of Indian tariff lines—representing nearly the entire trade value—will receive duty-free access to the UK market. At present, most Indian goods exported to the UK are subject to import duties ranging between 4 per cent and 18 per cent.The FTA is expected to unlock new export potential in key Indian sectors including textiles, marine products, leather, footwear, sports goods and toys, gems and jewellery, engineering goods, auto parts, and organic chemicals.","India and the UK signed the FTA on May 6, 2025, concluding nearly three years of negotiations aimed at deepening economic cooperation.

NEW DELHI: India on Saturday barred imports of various consumer items from Bangladesh through land transit posts in the northeastern states.The government also announced that ready-made garments from Bangladesh would be allowed entry only through the Kolkata and Nhava Sheva (Jawaharlal Nehru Port, Navi Mumbai) sea ports.""A new para 19 is introduced in 'General Notes Regarding Import Policy' under ITC (HS), 2022, Schedule 1 (Import Policy) regulating the import of certain goods from Bangladesh to India,"" a notification from the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), Ministry of commerce and industry, read.As per the notification, goods which cannot be imported to India from Bangladesh through Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Tripura (and West Bengal) include drinks (fruit/fruit flavoured; carbonated), processed food (baked goods, snacks, chips, confectionery), cotton/cotton yarn waste, plastic and PVC finished goods (except pigments, dyes, plasticisers, granules) and wooden furniture.There are 11 land transit points in India's northeastern states for trade between the two countries. Out of these, three are in Assam, two in Meghalaya and six in Tripura.However, neither curb would apply to the import of fish, LPG, edible oil and crushed stone from the neighbouring country. The exemption is also for items transiting through India but destined for Nepal and Bhutan.The move comes over a month after India ended transshipment facility for cargo from Bangladesh, dealing a blow to Dhaka exporting apparel through air freighters, largely from Delhi. New Delhi ended the transshipment facility against the backdrop of a controversial statement by the head of Bangladesh's interim government, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, on India's seven northeastern states during a state visit to China.There have been tensions between India and Bangladesh since August last year, when then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and came to Delhi following months of student-led protests against her.

Union Minister of Communications Jyotiraditya Scindia on Saturday said that India is poised to play a leading role in formulating global regulations for 6G technology, as the country continues to accelerate its presence in the global telecommunications landscape under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“A telecommunication revolution is rapidly unfolding across the globe, and India is at the forefront of this movement,” Scindia said while addressing an event on World Telecommunication and Information Society Day as reported PTI.Highlighting the country’s rapid strides in digital infrastructure, Scindia noted, “The rollout of 5G technology has taken place, and in just 22 months, the information revolution has reached 82 per cent of the population across 99 percent of districts in the country. India will take the lead in shaping the upcoming 6G technology regulations .”The minister also emphasized the transformative efforts underway within India Post, which he described as one of the largest logistics and distribution networks globally, with 1.64 lakh (164,000) post offices and 2.5 lakh (250,000) postal workers.“New services are being introduced in the postal system. In 2008, I designed the logo for the Department of Posts, with the slogan 'Postal Service is Public Service.' Every postal worker operates with this spirit.

India’s maritime sector to mirror post-1991 road revolution: DCIL CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-maritime-sector-to-mirror-post-1991-road-revolution-dcil-ceo/articleshow/121235679.cms,"DCIL CEO Durgesh Kumar Dubey

Just as roads transformed post-1991, the next 20 years will belong to India’s maritime sector, with dredging playing a critical role, said Durgesh Kumar Dubey , deputy chairman of Visakhapatnam Port Authority and managing director and CEO of Dredging Corporation of India Limited (DCIL).The Dredging India Conclave 2025, hosted by FICCI, convened leading voices from the maritime and infrastructure ecosystem to discuss the future of dredging and its role in realising India’s maritime potential.Speaking at the event, Dubey traced India's infrastructure evolution from post-liberalisation reforms to today's ambitious maritime initiatives. Reflecting on his personal experiences in Indian Railways and national infrastructure growth, he explained how early initiatives like the Golden Quadrilateral and Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana laid the groundwork for today’s robust logistics and connectivity framework.“This small program by FICCI is a step forward for a big leap in the maritime sector,” he said.Dubey also highlighted transformative initiatives such as the dedicated freight corridor and the recently announced Rs 25,000 crore maritime development Fund , along with the creation of Sagar Mala Development Corporation Ltd. (now an NBFC), as key enablers of growth in the sector.He cited Visakhapatnam Port as a case study of port-led industrialisation, where strategic port infrastructure catalysed industrial growth attracting major companies like HPCL, RINL, and AMNS.“Ports like Visakhapatnam have enabled the creation of industrial hubs supported by seamless road, rail, and air connectivity; this is the power of port-led growth,” Dubey said.Highlighting the dual nature of the dredging sector—capital dredging at major ports and smaller maintenance dredging—he said that both are vital for national development. As the head of DCIL, Dubey reaffirmed the company’s commitment to expanding its dredger fleet, including the upcoming TSHD Godavari (12,000 m³), and looking beyond India into high-demand regions like the Middle East and Southeast Asia.“There is a massive demand for dredging capacity, not only from new ports like Vizhinjam in Kerala or Galathea Bay in Nicobar but also from industries building their own captive ports across India,” he added.Dubey drew attention to the untapped potential of inland dredging, especially for reservoirs and canals suffering from siltation, which reduces water holding and flood management capacities. With aging dams across the country, he urged fleet manufacturers and contractors to focus on developing smaller suction and cutter dredgers tailored for inland water bodies.“This sector is growing fast. With the government’s focus on inland silt management, there’s recurring demand that can’t be ignored. Waterways are the most cost-effective and eco-friendly means of transport and maintaining them is both a business opportunity and a national imperative,” he said.Dubey also mentioned upcoming government meetings with key ministries to align efforts on this front, indicating a coordinated push towards waterway and reservoir dredging.He also made an open call for partnerships and investments in India’s dredging sector. He spoke about the need for capable contractors, innovative technologies, and aligned private-public collaboration to achieve national maritime goals.“DCI is ready to lead, but we need partners—investors, contractors, manufacturers—because without last-mile connectivity and execution support, our collective efforts may fall short,” he concluded.","The Dredging India Conclave 2025, hosted by FICCI, convened leading voices from the maritime and infrastructure ecosystem.

NEW DELHI: On the hottest day of the year so far, when Ayanagar in southwest Delhi recorded a day high of 44 degrees Celsius, the Commission for Air Quality Management invoked Stage I of the Graded Response Action Plan in Delhi-NCR on Friday after the air quality stagnated at the higher end of the ‘poor' range on Friday, with an AQI reading of 278, slightly lower than the 292 of the previous day.Having deferred invoking Stage I of GRAP on Thursday in the likelihood of AQI improving, CAQM said on Friday that the expected improvement in AQI wasn't and the index was only marginally lower at 278. ""The forecast by IMD/IITM also predicted AQI to be in the lower range of the ‘poor' category on Saturday,"" said CAQM, adding that it invoked the 27-point action plan in the first stage of GRAP in the entire NCR to prevent further deterioration of air quality.This is the fourth time this summer that Stage I was after March 7-15, March 24-29 and from April 2 to May 1. Among the measures envisaged are intensifying the use of anti-smog guns, water sprinkling and dust suppression in all construction areas, enforcing pollution control norms for motor vehicles, banning coal or firewood use in tandoors in hotels, restaurants and open eateries and prohibiting running of overaged vehicles.According to the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, AQI is likely to be ‘poor' on Saturday, but may improve to ‘moderate' by Sunday.Friday was a very hot day, though a sudden change with light to very light rain in the late afternoon provided some relief. Among the hottest areas of the city were Ayanagar at 44 degrees Celsius, Palam (43.3) and Ridge (43.2). The city's base weather station, Safdarjung, recorded a maximum temperature of 42.3 degrees Celsius, two above normal, against 40.6 degrees on Thursday.The minimum temperature was 26.2 degrees Celsius, normal for the season but higher than Thursday's 25.4 degrees. The humidity oscillated between 22% and 75%, while the city experienced north-westerly winds reaching 10 kmph.The evening rain was measured at 1.4mm at Safdarjung between 2.30pm and 5.30pm, though Ayanagar recorded 7.2mm and Ridge, 3mm.

Moody’s strips US of last triple-A credit rating over soaring debt: What it means for Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/moodys-strips-us-of-last-triple-a-credit-rating-over-soaring-debt-what-it-means-for-trump/articleshow/121225901.cms,"Moody's Investors Service

The United States lost its final top-tier credit rating on Friday as Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the country’s long-held Aaa rating to Aa1, citing ballooning government debt and persistent deficits.The move undermines President Donald Trump's economic narrative just as his flagship spending bill faces setbacks in Congress.The downgrade coincided with the failure of Trump’s proposed multi-trillion dollar tax and spending legislation to pass a key vote, stalled by Republican fiscal conservatives.Moody’s decision follows similar downgrades by S&P in 2011 and Fitch in 2023, leaving the United States without a single triple-A rating from the major credit rating agencies.Explaining its rationale, Moody’s said the shift was due to “the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns.”The agency projected federal deficits will rise to nearly 9% of GDP by 2035—up from 6.4% in 2023—driven largely by surging interest costs, entitlement spending, and limited revenue growth. As a consequence, US federal debt is expected to reach 134% of GDP by 2035, up from 98% last year.In response, the White House defended its fiscal record, and campaign communications director Steven Cheung lashed out at Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi. “Nobody takes his 'analysis' seriously. He has been proven wrong time and time again,” Cheung posted on X.Moody’s noted the downgrade reflected Washington’s repeated inability to address structural fiscal challenges. “Successive US administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,” the agency said, adding, “We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from current fiscal proposals under consideration. ”While Moody’s outlook was revised from “negative” to “stable,” it warned the nation’s fiscal standing is weakening “relative to its own past and compared to other highly-rated sovereigns.”Congressman French Hill, chair of the house financial services committee, called the downgrade “a strong reminder that our nation's fiscal house is not in order,” pledging that republicans would work to “restore fiscal stability, address the structural drivers of our debt, and foster a pro-growth economic environment.”The timing of the downgrade is politically charged. Trump’s proposed “big, beautiful” spending bill which includes a $5 trillion extension of his 2017 tax cuts and controversial reductions to Medicaid is a cornerstone of his campaign messaging on economic stewardship.Despite the downgrade, Moody’s acknowledged US economic strengths, saying the country “retains exceptional credit strengths such as the size, resilience and dynamism of its economy and the role of the US dollar as global reserve currency.”",Moody's Investors Service downgraded the country’s long-held Aaa rating to Aa1.

"Japan's economy shrinks in the first quarter, dragged by US tariff tensions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/japans-economy-shrinks-in-the-first-quarter-dragged-by-us-tariff-tensions/articleshow/121214892.cms,"The Japanese economy took a hit for the first time in a year, weighed down by fragile domestic demand and trade tensions with the US. Preliminary government data released on Friday showed that the gross domestic product (GDP) fell at an annualised rate of 0.7% in the January-March quarter, significantly worse than the market’s forecast for a 0.2% drop. On a quarterly basis, GDP contracted 0.2%, double the expected 0.1% decline.The downturn was largely driven by flat private consumption, which makes up more than half of Japan's economic output, and a sharp drop in exports indicating that the economy was losing support from external demand even before US President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on April 2.According to a Reuters report, analysts warned that the situation could worsen once the full impact of tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump begins to bite.“Japan’s economy lacks a driver of growth given weakness in exports and consumption. It’s very vulnerable to shocks such as one from Trump tariffs,” said Yoshiki Shinke, senior executive economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.“The data may lead to growing calls for bigger fiscal spending,” he added, warning that another contraction in the second quarter cannot be ruled out.While there were some bright spots like capital spending rising by 1.4%, and fourth-quarter GDP growth being revised up slightly to 2.4% external demand was a major drag.Exports fell by 0.6% while imports rose 2.9%, shaving 0.8 percentage point off growth.The GDP deflator rose 3.3% year-on-year, showing that companies are passing on rising costs. Still, that hasn’t been enough to lift overall momentum, especially as uncertainty looms over Japan’s key automobile sector, a major export engine.Japanese automakers are already feeling the pressure amid uncertain trade tensions. Toyota expected its profit to drop by a fifth in the current financial year. US President Trump announced a 10% tariff on all countries except for Canada, Mexico and China alongside higher tariffs for big trading partners like 24% for Japan. These tariffs are said to take effect from July unless the countries can manage to negotiate a deal with Washington.Japan's economic revitalisation minister Ryosei Akazawa acknowledged the challenges ahead, noting that wage growth could provide some support but trade risks remained a serious concern.“We must be mindful of downside risks to the economy from US tariff policy. The hit to consumption and household sentiment from continued price rises is also a risk to growth,” Akazawa said during a press conference, quoted by Reuters.“The early-year contraction serves as a reminder of Japan’s economic struggles. Tariff pain and weak domestic momentum will weigh on growth in the quarters ahead,” said Stefan Angrick, head of Japan and Frontier Markets Economics at Moody’s Analytics.The weaker data is likely to increase political pressure on Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to introduce fresh stimulus or tax cuts, though Akazawa insisted no such measures are currently planned.At the same time, the Bank of Japan is navigating its own set of complications. Having raised interest rates to 0.5% in January after ending a decade of ultra-loose policy, the central bank is now under pressure to hold back on further hikes. In early May, it slashed its growth forecasts, citing fears of a global slowdown.Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute, said, “If the impact of Trump tariffs is fairly light, the BOJ could raise interest rates again in September or October. But if the tariffs deal a severe blow to capital spending and exports, rate hikes could be put on hold.”","GDP fell at an annualised rate of 0.7% in the January-March quarter. On a quarterly basis, GDP contracted 0.2%, double the expected 0.1% decline. The downturn was largely driven by flat private consumption and a sharp drop in exports.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121214876,imgsize-362128,width-400,resizemode-4/121214876.jpg"

Akasa Air is gearing up for a major expansion this fiscal year, after a year of muted growth, buying planes and expanding flight operations to new regions. The low-cost carrier currently contributes 5% to India’s domestic traffic.The airline plans to launch international flights to one of the most sought-after regions for Indian travellers, southeast Asia.However, having only Boeing planes in its fleet, the group has faced challenges to expand operations as the manufacturer has been going through a production slump.Akasa chief commercial officer Praveen Iyer told ET, ""The constraints seem to have been addressed to a large extent. Boeing had a peculiar issue and that's resolved, which is good news.""“The good news is the worst is behind the supply,” Iyer added.He further added that they will be back on track for more deliveries this year, “we are happy with how the deliveries are scheduled for the rest of the year.”In the upcoming months, Akasa is aiming to increase its available seat kilometres, a key measure of airline capacity, by 30–40%.Akasa had initially ordered 72 Boeing 737 Max aircraft in 2022 and later added four more to that order.In January this year, it placed an additional order for 150 aircraft of the same type.However, deliveries were delayed after Boeing faced intensified scrutiny from regulators and airlines following a mid-air incident in January involving a door plug detachment.As the production issues are gradually resolving, Akasa now plans to ramp up its international presence.“We have been consistently adding capacity on the international markets. Over the next several months you will see us making some announcements about addition of flights to Far East destinations,” Iyer said.He also highlighted that the upcoming Noida and Navi Mumbai airports will be game-changers for international connectivity from India’s busiest aviation hubs.",Akasa Air is gearing up for a major expansion this fiscal year.

The Abu Dhabi-based carrier confirmed on Friday that it will buy 28 wide-body Boeing aircraft, all powered by GE engines, as per Reuters.The aircraft, a mix of Boeing 787s and the next-generation 777X – will begin joining Etihad’s fleet from 2028, as the airline looks to modernise and expand its operations. The White House described the deal as a significant boost for US manufacturing and exports “With the inclusion of the next-generation 777X in its fleet plan, the investment deepens the longstanding commercial aviation partnership between the UAE and the United States,” the White House said. “It fuels American manufacturing and drives exports.”Etihad said the order reflects its “ongoing approach to aligning its fleet with evolving network and operational needs.” The airline currently operates a fleet of around 100 aircraft.Etihad CEO Antonoaldo Neves, who has overseen the airline’s growth following a period of restructuring, said last month that the company plans to bring in 20 to 22 new aircraft this year alone. That includes ten Airbus A321LRs, six Airbus A350s, and four Boeing 787s. The A321LRs, unveiled earlier this week, are expected to enter service in August.The airline, which is owned by Abu Dhabi’s $225 billion sovereign wealth fund ADQ, aims to grow its fleet to more than 170 aircraft by 2030, supporting the UAE capital’s wider economic diversification plans.Meanwhile, Boeing also scored another major win this week with a separate deal in the Gulf.

China's GDP growth to slow down to 4.6% reflecting subdued consumer sentiment: UN report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-gdp-growth-to-slow-down-to-4-6-reflecting-subdued-consumer-sentiment-un-report/articleshow/121211040.cms,"Global front



The United Nations revised its global economic growth forecast downward to 2.4% for 2025, down from 2.9 in 2024, warning that rising trade tensions, looming policy uncertainty, and geopolitical volatility are weighing down the world economy to a fragile position.The report also showed a slowdown in major economies. In China, the economy is expected to grow at 4.6% from 5% in 2024, dragged down by weak consumer demand, disrupted export-oriented manufacturing and challenges in the property sector.Despite solid growth in the first quarter, net exports are expected to push down the overall growth in 2025 due to tariff-related shocks. However, policy measures introduced in March 2025, aimed at boosting consumption, encouraging investment, and stabilizing the property market are likely to cushion the impact.Recently, in a bid to boost domestic demand amid growing external pressures, the People’s Bank of China cut policy rates. Alongside this, it also launched a more ambitious fiscal expansion, increasing the fiscal deficit from 3% of GDP in 2024 to 4% in 2025, to fund a variety of measures.In the longer term, advancing structural reforms to drive the economy toward domestic consumption remains crucial for sustained resilience.The report showed that unemployment in the country increased modestly during early 2025 and increasing US tariffs were further expected to pressurise the export oriented industries even more.It further said that China, a large economy, has seen wage gains in recent years.The report says that emerging economies such as Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa are also seeing downward revisions, as falling commodity prices and weaker investment weigh on their prospects.According to the report, the global economy remains fragile amid rising trade tensions and policy uncertainty. It also warned that a sharp rise in US tariffs could drive up production costs, disrupt global supply chains, and heighten financial instability.","The United Nations revised its global economic growth forecast downward to 2.4% for 2025, down from 2.9 in 2024.

The Trump complication

CHIPS act vs tariff whiplash

From intel roots to AI futures

The global picture — and local stakes

America’s bold ambition to lead the global semiconductor race is facing unexpected headwinds, not from competitors, but from within. As US President Donald Trump floats fresh tariffs and threatens the very subsidies that sparked a manufacturing resurgence, tech executives and economic leaders are sounding alarms.Semiconductor giants, once hopeful about America’s CHIPS Act-powered comeback, are now grappling with a new layer of uncertainty.Nowhere is the chip boom more visible than in Greater Sacramento. Intel’s presence since 1984 has long anchored the region, but recent years have seen a tech renaissance. Companies like AMD, Samsung, Micron, and Bosch have expanded operations, banking on federal support and California’s deep talent pool.German tech firm Bosch, for instance, is transforming its Roseville site into a next-gen chip hub for electric vehicles with a $1.9 billion investment, the largest in California in three decades. It's expected to generate 1,700 new jobs.“During the pandemic, we saw how dangerous it was to rely on offshore chip manufacturing,” said Barry Broome, head of the Greater Sacramento Economic Council. “That moment made it abundantly clear, we need domestic production.”But just as ground is breaking and factories are rising, Trump’s proposed tariffs and attacks on the CHIPS Act threaten to reverse momentum.“You’re starting to see the impact,” said Mario Morales of IDC. “Samsung’s Texas fab is now delayed from 2024 to 2028. Uncertainty about funding and trade policy is making companies hesitate.”The Trump administration says it wants to probe foreign subsidies and overcapacity — but critics warn the timing is poor. With America’s share of global chip manufacturing already down to 10% (from 37% in 1990), any slowdown risks losing the AI race.Passed in 2022 with bipartisan support, the CHIPS and Science Act aimed to reboot US chip production and secure military-grade tech independence. It’s working, a May 2024 report forecasts the fastest global capacity growth right here in the US.But if the CHIPS Act is undercut by new tariffs or policy reversals, progress could stall. “If tariffs are just leverage for better deals, we’ll rebound quickly,” Broome said. “If they’re long-term, capital investment will freeze.”Sacramento’s chip scene is also becoming an AI frontier. Dinakar Munagala, cofounder of AI chipmaker Blaize, says their domestically built chips are attracting attention from defense and security sectors.“We’re built here,” said Munagala. “That’s why there’s demand for our products, especially for high-security use cases like airports and border control.”Blaize board chair Lane Bess believes the region is poised to lead globally. “Talent from companies like Intel is now launching the next generation of chip startups here.”Analysts like Alvin Nguyen warn that tariff confusion will ripple across supply chains. Even consumer products like the Nintendo Switch 2 have seen delays due to pricing uncertainty.In the long term, global diversification of chip foundries may ease reliance on Taiwan. But right now, the stakes in Sacramento, and the nation, are high.",America’s bold ambition to lead the global semiconductor race is facing unexpected headwinds.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"
E-commerce firm Udaan raises $340 million ahead of planned IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-firm-udaan-raises-340-million-ahead-of-planned-ipo/articleshow/105991030.cms,"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners , and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners , formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart.

That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.
