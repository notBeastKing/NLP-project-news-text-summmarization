Who all is the Permanent Ban warning for



The US Embassy in India has issued a Permanent Ban warning. The embassy's warning comes in a social media post on Twitter from the American's embassy's official account, U.S. Embassy India. This is the third Twitter post regarding illegal immigration made by the US embassy in India this month so far. It is not clear what is exactly the reason behind these special and frequent warnings. In a new policy change under the Donald Trump government, all foreign nationals staying in the US for over 30 days are required to register with the federal government -- in a new immigration rule change.The latest warning from the American embassy reads: ""If you remain in the United States beyond your authorized period of stay, you could be deported and could face a permanent ban on traveling to the United States in the future.""Earlier this month in another related post from the US Embassy in India handle said, ""The U.S. government has launched a coordinated interagency effort to combat fraud and end illegal immigration. Those found guilty of visa fraud will face permanent bans from entering the United States. New visa restriction policies apply to individuals and foreign governments who facilitate illegal immigration.""Not directly linked to Indians travelling to America, but another post on illegal immigration was shared by the embassy in May beginning. ""The United States is working to reduce border threats at home and abroad in partnership with outmigration and transit countries. We also thank our partners for supporting U.S. efforts to deter illegal immigration by facilitating the return of deportees,"" the post read.This warning/advisory is applicable to all Indian citizens who are traveling to America on their various time-bound visas like work visas, student visas, tourist visas etc. All these visas have their own authorised period of stay. The advisory is aimed as a reminder for travellers to the US on various non-immigrant visas to strictly adhere to the validity period granted at the time they enter the US by the Immigration authorities. The American embassy highlighted that even a brief overstay can carry serious legal consequences.","The US Embassy in India has issued a Permanent Ban warning.

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt may have just agreed with ‘AI warning’ of Nvidia’s Jensen Huang,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/former-google-ceo-eric-schmidt-may-have-just-agreed-with-ai-warning-of-nvidias-jensen-huang/articleshow/121239050.cms,"‘This is a marathon’, says Eric Schmidt

Jensen Huang’s ‘AI warning’ to professionals

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has cautioned that professionals across all sectors, from artists to doctors, risk becoming irrelevant if they fail to quickly embrace artificial intelligence (AI), echoing Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ’s warning by stating that people risk losing their jobs to other professionals who use AI technology.In a recent TED interview, Schmidt argued that the rapid advancement of AI is causing a fundamental shift in every job. He urged everyone to adopt the technology swiftly to remain competitive within their fields.Schmidt, who served as the CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011, highlighted his recent acquisition of a rocket company as an example of AI's power to accelerate learning in new domains.“It’s an area that I’m not an expert in, and I want to be an expert,” he said and cited studies projecting a potential ""30% increase in productivity"" annually due to AI.While acknowledging the potential for AI to disrupt or automate entire industries, Schmidt believes some professions will evolve rather than disappear, using lawyers as an example of a field that will likely see more sophisticated applications.“Do you really think that we’re going to get rid of lawyers? No, they’re just going to have more sophisticated lawsuits,” he said.Schmidt offered a long-term perspective, stating, ""One thing to remember is that this is a marathon, not a sprint. Every day you get up, and you just keep going.""Speaking recently at the Milken Institute’s Global Conference 2025, Huang said every job will be affected by AI.“Some jobs will be lost, some jobs will be created; but every job will be affected,” he said, adding, “You are not going to lose your job to AI, but you are going to lose your job to somebody who uses AI.”He also urged attendees to embrace the technology, advising, “Don't be that person who ignores this technology and this result loses you.”","Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has cautioned that professionals across all sectors, from artists to doctors, risk becoming irrelevant if they fail to embrace artificial intelligence.

BYJU'S founder Byju Raveendran on 'Best' and 'Worst' decision the company made and 'Missed' opportunity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/byjus-founder-byju-raveendran-on-the-best-and-worst-decision-the-company-made-and-the-missed-opportunity/articleshow/121241784.cms,"'Worst' Decision that BYJU'S Made

Akash Acquisition Termed 'Best' Decision

Missed Opportunity with WhiteHat Jr

Grew too fast globally, expanded to 21 countries in two years

BCCI Payments and Insolvency Proceedings

BYJU'S founder Byju Raveendran has confessed that securing a USD 1.2 billion term loan in 2021 was a significant error for the company. Speaking to ANI, Raveendran stated that this decision was made collectively with the board, which included both investor and founder directors. He emphasized that the company was not in a desperate financial situation at the time, having previously raised $5 billion. Reflecting on the decision, Raveendran acknowledged that BYJU'S had alternative equity funding avenues available. Launched in 2015, BYJU'S achieved unicorn status by 2019 and reached a peak valuation of USD 22 billion in 2022. However, in June 2024, Prosus significantly slashed BYJU'S valuation by 75 percent.Raveendran admitted that the term loan ultimately played a role in the financial challenges the Bengaluru-based edtech company is currently facing, which include regulatory scrutiny and legal battles. ""Only mistake if you ask me, which created all this is that we shouldn't have taken this, when we had enough equity options, we shouldn't have taken this term loan at that time in 2021. One billion (USD) because it was, like, we had other options. We have raised 5 billion before that. We were not doing it out of desperation. It was all collective decision. Today everyone, like our board was like three founder directors and three investor directors. They were there till 2020,"" Raveendran said.Despite the challenges, Raveendran highlighted the acquisition of Aakash Educational Services Ltd (AESL) as one of BYJU'S ""best acquisitions."" He acknowledged that while some of the six major acquisitions may not have performed as expected, the success of others, like Akash, is often overshadowed. BYJU'S acquired Aakash in April 2021 for approximately $950 million in a cash-and-stock deal.Raveendran also lamented a missed opportunity with WhiteHat Jr., stating that the concept of Indian teachers instructing students globally in mathematics was a ""huge opportunity lost.""Raveendran admitted that BYJU'S expanded ""too fast"" into 21 countries, driven by a ""mandate"" from its global investors to grow and transform learning. He suggested that a more gradual approach might have been prudent. ""When we tried expanding from India to the whole world, We made some business mistakes. Maybe we could have taken it a little bit slowly. We were growing a little too soon, too fast. We went from India to 21 new countries. But if you ask me, in that context of 2019 to 2021, the COVID era, We have 160 investors, world-class investors, and equity investors. All of them - this was the mandate grow, grow, grow and change the way kids learn,"" Raveendran told ANI.Regarding payments to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), Raveendran explained that BYJU'S had paid a substantial amount (nearly ₹1500 crore) but faced a liquidity crunch for the final ₹158 crore, leading to BCCI approaching the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). He stated that a settlement has been reached with BCCI following the company's admission into the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP), and BYJU'S should be out of insolvency soon.","BYJU'S founder Byju Raveendran has confessed that securing a USD 1.2 billion term loan in 2021 was a significant error for the company.

Donald Trump vs Bruce Springsteen goes long back

President Donald Trump seems very angry with US-born Singer Bruce Springsteen. Springsteen started his 2025 Europe tour recently with a concert in Manchester, England. At the concert, he reportedly spoke about Donald Trump’s government, calling it “corrupt, not good at its job, and doing things that go against the country.” As per the reports, Springsteen said that the America he loves is being run by people who don’t know what they’re doing. He reportedly asked people to “rise against authoritarianism and let freedom ring” “the power of art, music, and rock ‘n’ roll is important during dangerous times.An angry Donald Trump blasted the singer in a post on Truth Social. Trump called Springsteen “highly overrated,” “not a talented guy,” and a “pushy, obnoxious JERK.” Trump went on to add, “This dried out ‘prune’ of a rocker ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country.” Trump brought up Joe Biden, calling him “Sleepy Joe” and said Springsteen is “dumb as a rock.” He further wrote, “We’ll all see how it goes for him,” suggesting there might be consequences when Springsteen returns to the U.S.Trump also criticised Taylor Swift, a vocal Trump critic. Trump's statement made the American Federation of Musicians release a statement defending Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift. According to the reports, The American Federation of Musicians said, “Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift are not just brilliant musicians, they are role models and inspirations to millions. He added. “musicians have the right to freedom of expression.”Incidentally, Springsteen has criticised Trump multiple times, once calling him a “moron” who’s taken the country under siege. He criticised Trump's border policy during his first term as President as well. In June 2018, during a one-man Broadway show, he slammed Donald Trump’s border-control policy. According to a report in The New Yorker then, Springsteen stood “on a bare stage and under a simple spotlight” to reflect on the renewed significance of the March for Our Lives protest after witnessing the traumatic scenes from detention centers at the border in recent days.“It was a good day, and a necessary day, because we are seeing things right now on our American borders that are so shockingly and disgracefully inhumane and un-American that it is simply enraging,” he said. “And we have heard people in high positions in the American government blaspheme in the name of God and country that it is a moral thing to assault the children amongst us. May God save our souls.”","Donald Trump seems very angry with US-born Singer Bruce Springsteen. Springsteen started his 2025 Europe tour recently with a concert in Manchester, England.

"MAGA supporters fume over H-1B visas: '20,000 H-1B visas have been approved for 2026, Not ...,' says Laura Loomer; Steve Bannon wants all to go back",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/maga-supporters-fume-at-h-1b-visas-20000-h-1b-visas-have-been-approved-for-2026-not-says-laura-loomer-steve-bannon-wants-all-to-go-back/articleshow/121240941.cms,"Representative Image

H-1B visas the Big divide among MAGA supporters: Elon Musk, David Sacks, Steve Bannon and long list...

The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has announced that 120,141 H-1B visa applications have been selected for 2026. This figure marks the lowest number of selections since 2021, a development attributed to various factors including the annual H-1B cap, increased application fees, and potentially a cooling demand amidst economic uncertainties and layoffs in some sectors. ""During the registration period for the FY 2026 H-1B cap, we saw a significant decrease in the total number of registrations submitted and eligible beneficiaries compared to FY 2025, including a decrease in the number of registrations submitted on behalf of beneficiaries with multiple registrations,"" said USCIS in a release on its website.Despite this multi-year low in selections, the announcement has ignited a fresh wave of debate, particularly among supporters of the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement. Some within this political sphere have expressed outrage over what they perceive as a ""huge"" number of approvals, echoing long-standing concerns that the H-1B program facilitates the displacement of American workers.Laura Loomer, a prominent figure and staunch Donald Trump supporter, voiced her discontent on social media, stating, ""US workers are being replaced. 120,000 H-1B visas have been approved for 2026. Not good."" Loomer has been a vocal critic of the H-1B program and played a central role in a recent internal division within the MAGA camp regarding the appropriate levels of high-skilled immigration.This internal debate has pitted figures like Elon Musk, David Sacks, and Vivek Ramaswamy, who have advocated for an increase in the H-1B quota to address perceived shortages of specialized talent and maintain U.S. competitiveness, against those like Steve Bannon, former advisor to President Trump, and Laura Loomer. This latter group argues for stricter limits on H-1B visas, prioritizing American workers for available jobs. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is a very strong supporter of H-1B visas. In an open fight late last year, Elon Musk said that he is ""ready to go to war"" on H-1B visas.Steve Bannon has been particularly vocal in his opposition to the latest H-1B selections, labeling the number of approvals as ""outrageous."" He argued that in an economic climate characterized by mass layoffs and the increasing capabilities of artificial intelligence, the approval of any new H-1B visas is unwarranted. ""The number of H-1Bs we need this year is ZERO,"" Bannon asserted, further stating, ""Everyone issued one should go home, and every billet should be filled by an American."" This stance reflects a broader sentiment among some that foreign workers are taking jobs that could and should be filled by American citizens.The lower number of H-1B selections for FY 2026, while statistically the lowest in several years, has done little to quell the anxieties of those who believe the program harms American workers. The debate over the H-1B visa program continues to be a contentious issue, reflecting broader disagreements about immigration, workforce needs, and the competitiveness of the U.S. economy in a globalized world. The differing viewpoints within the MAGA movement underscore the complexity of this issue and the diverse perspectives even among those who share similar political ideologies.","USCIS has announced that 120,141 H-1B visa applications have been selected for 2026.

Microsoft has announced that both internal and external reviews found no evidence that its Azure cloud or AI technologies have been used by the Israeli military to cause harm to Palestinian civilians or others in Gaza. The statement comes amid ongoing scrutiny over the company’s ties to Israel, and just weeks after Microsoft fired two employees — including one of Indian origin — who staged a pro-Palestinian protest during the company’s 50th anniversary celebrations.Reports suggest that in recent months, there have also been repeated calls from within the company for Microsoft to sever its contracts with the Israeli government, citing ethical concerns about how its technology might be used in the ongoing conflict.The software giant explained that its relationship with the Israel Ministry of Defense (IMOD) is a ""standard commercial relationship."" Following the reviews, Microsoft reported that it has ""found no evidence that Microsoft’s Azure and AI technologies, or any of our other software, have been used to harm people or that IMOD has failed to comply with our terms of service or our AI Code of Conduct.""The company's AI code of conduct mandates human oversight and access controls to prevent its services from causing harm in violation of the law.""We do occasionally provide special access to our technologies beyond the terms of our commercial agreements.

However, the company acknowledged a limitation, noting that it ""does not have visibility into how customers use our software on their own servers or other devices,"" thus restricting the scope of their findings.","Microsoft has announced that both internal and external reviews found no evidence that its cloud or AI technologies have been used by the Israeli military.

Why Mark Zuckerberg starts his day without coffee? Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-mark-zuckerberg-starts-his-day-without-coffee-know-about-facebook-founders-viral-rawdog-routine/articleshow/120843936.cms,"Why Mark Zuckerberg starts his day without coffee? Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine

‘rawdog’ morning routine

Mark Zuckerberg follows the ‘Rawdog’ routine, know what it is

Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine key elements

1. No caffeine or external stimulants

Zuckerberg completely avoids caffeine in the mornings. While caffeine is widely used to combat fatigue and boost focus, he believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity.

This is in stark contrast to other tech leaders who often depend on multiple doses of caffeine throughout the day.

2. Intense physical activity: Brazilian jiu-jitsu and MMA

A central element of Zuckerberg’s morning is two hours of combat sports training, particularly Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA).

These are not light workouts. Zuckerberg actively engages in grappling and sparring, where split-second focus is essential.

He has stated that unlike running, which allows for mental wandering, jiu-jitsu requires full presence—a factor that helps him “recenter” and transition into work mode.

3. Mental presence and focus

The high-pressure nature of combat sports trains the brain to respond quickly under stress.

Zuckerberg uses these sessions to reset mentally, describing them as more effective than caffeine in waking up both the body and mind.

The risk of failure (being pinned or tapped out) keeps him focused, which in turn reduces stress from external sources.

4. Simplified lifestyle to reduce decision fatigue

Zuckerberg is known for his repetitive wardrobe—gray T-shirts, jeans, and sneakers. This choice is deliberate and helps him save cognitive effort for high-stakes decisions.

Reducing daily trivial choices aligns with psychological research indicating that decision fatigue can impair judgment over time.

5. High-protein diet and caloric intake

Why Zuckerberg chose this path: The influence of early education

How Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine powers executive performance

Enhanced cognitive function

Martial arts require constant anticipation, pattern recognition, and strategic thinking, which parallels the kind of problem-solving skills needed in high-level business decisions.

Stress management

Physical exertion is scientifically linked to lower cortisol levels and improved mood. Zuckerberg’s training acts as a buffer against the chronic stress of running a global tech company.

Improved executive functioning

The combination of simplified choices, physical rigor, and mental clarity supports better decision-making and reduced mental fatigue during the workday.

How Zuckerberg’s routine compared to Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, other tech leaders

Executive

Routine Element

Elon Musk

High caffeine intake, long work hours

Jack Dorsey

Fasting, meditation, cold plunges

Jeff Bezos

Prioritizes sleep, slow mornings

Tim Cook

Early rising with structured exercise



Scientific perspective on ‘Rawdog’ routines

Exercise improves executive functioning, especially activities that demand coordination and focus.

Caffeine-free mornings may lead to more stable energy levels, avoiding midday crashes associated with stimulant withdrawal.

Simplified routines reduce decision fatigue, as shown in studies on successful leaders and their minimalist approaches.

Routines are known to play a vital role in shaping the lives and productivity of high achievers across industries. Whether it’s elite athletes, creative professionals, or technology entrepreneurs, the way they start their day often sets the tone for how they approach challenges and decision-making. Among these successful individuals, Mark Zuckerberg—founder of Facebook and CEO of Meta—stands out not just for his innovations in the digital world but also for his unconventional personal discipline. His so-calledhas recently drawn public attention for its no-frills, stimulant-free approach to productivity and mental clarity.Unlike many of his peers in Silicon Valley who lean on coffee, energy drinks, or even mind-enhancing drugs to kick-start their day, Zuckerberg’s morning begins with no artificial aids. Instead, he embraces natural energy, physical intensity, and mental focus through a carefully structured regimen centered on Brazilian jiu-jitsu and minimalism. This article provides an in-depth, non-opinionated breakdown of Zuckerberg’s unique routine, detailing its structure, rationale, and implications for performance and mental resilience.The term ‘rawdog routine’, as used by Zuckerberg, refers to a lifestyle approach that entails confronting reality and the demands of the day without the aid of stimulants, drugs, or performance enhancers. The concept is based on the idea of beginning one’s day in a fully natural and present state. For Zuckerberg, this means no coffee, no cannabis, no nootropics, and no artificial substances that could alter his mental state. He has occasionally referred to drinking coffee recreationally while on vacation, but emphasizes that it is never a part of his regular workday schedule.This method, according to Zuckerberg, is about achieving mental clarity and physical readiness through discipline rather than chemical shortcuts. The only supplements he reportedly uses are creatine and vitamin D, both commonly accepted for muscle recovery and general health support.Zuckerberg’s rawdog morning routine is built on five foundational principles, all of which are designed to enhance productivity, reduce stress, and maintain mental sharpness.While Zuckerberg does not publicly share a specific meal plan, it is known that he consumes a high-protein diet, which is critical for recovery and energy post-training.Reports suggest his daily caloric intake may reach up to 4,000 calories, especially to meet the energy demands of intensive physical activity.Zuckerberg has cited his exposure to the DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program in school as a formative influence behind his stance against drugs and stimulants. This early education helped shape his views on substance use and led to a personal policy of natural energy dependence, rather than chemical performance enhancements.Unlike other Silicon Valley executives who have publicly discussed experimenting with microdosing psychedelics or using smart drugs (nootropics), Zuckerberg maintains a more grounded, drug-free approach to focus and performance.Zuckerberg’s morning routine is not just a personal wellness strategy—it appears to have professional implications as well. Here’s how it aligns with executive performance demands:While Zuckerberg avoids all forms of chemical stimulation, other tech leaders have taken diverse approaches to optimizing performance:Zuckerberg’s ‘rawdog’ method is unique in its emphasis on no external stimulants, which sets it apart from the above figures.While no clinical studies have yet been conducted on Zuckerberg’s specific regimen, related research suggests:","Zuckerberg’s morning includes two hours of Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA) He believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity.

Microsoft becomes world's most-valuable company and its No 1 position also has 'Trump Tariff' message on Apple,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-becomes-worlds-most-valuable-company-and-its-no-1-position-also-has-trump-tariff-message-on-apple/articleshow/120845348.cms,"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella



Trump Tariff pains 'hurting' Apple

Microsoft has once again ascended to World's Most Valuable company, overtaking Apple. Software giant Microsoft has claimed the title of the world's most valuable company as the week concluded, boasting a market capitalization of $3.235 trillion. This milestone positions them ahead of Apple , which had long held the top spot, with the iPhone maker's market cap closing on Friday (May 2) at $3.07 trillion.Securing the third position is Nvidia , whose valuation stands at $2.76 trillion, as reported by The Information's newsletter.The surge in Microsoft's stock price on Thursday fueled this shift, following the release of robust financial results for the March quarter that surpassed analyst forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted the sustained strong demand for the company's cloud services and artificial intelligence (AI) offerings during an investor call.Throughout the year, Microsoft's shares have consistently outpaced Apple's, signaling growing investor confidence in the tech giant's strategic focus on AI and cloud computing. Notably, this significant post-earnings stock jump for Microsoft echoes a similar event in October 2015, when the burgeoning Azure cloud business witnessed revenue more than double, propelling shares upward by 10%, according to Investopedia.While Apple also delivered better-than-expected first-quarter results, buoyed by strong iPhone sales , the company is facing headwinds from newly implemented tariffs under President Donald Trump.Apple's extensive reliance on imported components within its supply chain renders it particularly vulnerable to the impact of these tariffs. Consequently, its share price has experienced a significant 18% decline since the beginning of the year, marking one of the most substantial drops among major technology companies.Furthermore, CEO Tim Cook has indicated that Apple anticipates an additional $900 million in costs this quarter due to the tariffs, unless the current conditions change.According to Dow Jones Market Data, as reported by NewsMax, Apple's decrease in market value represents the largest for any company at the start of this year. Among the leading tech firms, only Tesla has witnessed a steeper year-to-date decline in its shares, falling by 29%.","Microsoft's market cap now stands at $3.235 trillion, overtaking Apple.

Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools

Google claims breakup ""impossible"" without serious consequences

The US Justice Department have asked a federal judge to break up Google's advertising technology business, marking the second government request within a year that could fundamentally reshape the $2 trillion giant. During a hearing in Virginia, DOJ lawyers outlined plans to force Google to divest key components of its online advertising system following Judge Leonie M. Brinkema's April ruling that Google illegally monopolized portions of the digital advertising market .""To leave Google with 90 percent of publishers beholden to them is, frankly, too dangerous,"" said Julia Tarver Wood, the government's lead attorney in the case. The hearing established September 22 as the date when both parties will present detailed arguments about remedies.The Justice Department's proposal specifically targets Google's ad exchange—the technology connecting buyers and sellers of online ad space—along with tools used by website publishers to sell advertising inventory. The government plan would initially make Google's auction code available to publishers and other ad tech companies, followed by requiring Google to fully divest publisher tools that handle functions like record keeping.This latest action follows a separate antitrust case in Washington where the DOJ is seeking to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser to address monopolistic behavior in the search market. If both requests are granted, it would represent the most significant government-mandated corporate restructuring since AT&T's breakup in the 1980s.Google's defense team strongly opposed the breakup proposal, arguing it fails to comply with legal precedent and would create significant problems. Karen Dunn, Google's lead attorney, called the plan ""very likely completely impossible"" without causing serious problems, noting few potential buyers exist for the technology besides ""enormous tech companies.""Google instead proposed changing certain business practices and opening its ad auction bidding system in ways that would benefit publishers, while arguing that divesting these technologies would eliminate important security and privacy protections the company currently provides.Judge Brinkema ruled last month that Google had illegally monopolized both publisher tools and ad exchange software, though she dismissed claims related to advertiser tools. The business in question represents only a portion of Google's massive online advertising revenue, which funds its free services like Maps, Gmail, and search.","Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools.

GTA 6 release and updates FAQs

What is the official release date of GTA 6?

Grand Theft Auto VI will launch on May 26, 2026, according to Rockstar’s announcement on May 2, 2025.

Why was GTA 6 delayed from 2025?

Rockstar stated that the delay was to ensure the game meets the quality expectations of players and the studio’s own development standards.

What platforms will GTA 6 be available on?

Although not officially confirmed, GTA 6 is expected to be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Will there be new trailers before the release?

Yes, Rockstar has confirmed that more information and footage will be released in the months following the release date announcement.

Is GTA 6 connected to previous games?

The game is expected to have a new setting (modern Vice City) and new characters but may include easter eggs or references to previous titles.

Rockstar Games has finally confirmed the release date for GTA 6, setting the launch for May 26, 2026. The announcement comes after years of speculation, rumors, and growing anticipation from fans and the gaming industry alike. With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025.

"Facing Donald Trump's 'fund threat', Chicago turns to EY",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facing-donald-trumps-fund-threat-chicago-turns-to-ey/articleshow/121232833.cms,"Chicago is not the only state facing this 'Donald Trump threat'

What will EY do to Chicago and other states if enrolled

Chicago is reportedly taking significant steps to address a looming financial challenge, engaging the global professional services firm Ernst & Young LLP (EY) to identify cost-saving measures and strategies to bridge projected budget deficits exceeding $1 billion in each of the next two fiscal years. This move underscores the growing fiscal pressures facing the city under the leadership of first-term Mayor Brandon Johnson, who recently completed his second year in office.According to a report in Bloomberg, the engagement of EY signals a proactive approach by the Johnson administration to tackle these substantial budget gaps. The consulting firm will work in tandem with a newly established working group, co-led by Jim Reynolds of Loop Capital, to develop comprehensive recommendations aimed at bolstering Chicago's long-term financial stability. This collaborative effort suggests a broad strategy involving both external expertise and local financial acumen.Mayor Johnson's administration is navigating a complex economic landscape, marked by a slowing national economy. Adding to these domestic pressures are potential external threats, notably President Donald Trump 's stated intention to potentially withhold federal funding from state and local governments that do not align with his policies. This threat creates a significant layer of uncertainty for Chicago's budget planning, as the potential loss of federal funds could exacerbate existing deficits and necessitate difficult decisions regarding city services.Chicago is not alone in facing this predicament. Several other major metropolitan areas with Democratic mayors, including Boston, Denver, and New York City, are grappling with similar economic headwinds and the potential for federal funding cuts. If President Trump follows through on his threats, these cities could be forced to implement austerity measures, potentially impacting essential services that their large urban populations rely upon. This shared challenge highlights a broader tension between federal policy and the fiscal realities of major urban centers.The composition of the newly formed working group reflects a multi-stakeholder approach to finding solutions. According to a city statement released on Friday, the panel will include representatives from labor unions, prominent businesses such as Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, and various civic organizations. Furthermore, several members of the Chicago City Council will participate as part of an advisory group within the broader panel, ensuring legislative input and buy-in for the eventual recommendations.Chicago's Chief Financial Officer, Jill Jaworski, told Bloomberg that the engagement of EY is specifically aimed at identifying operational efficiencies and exploring ways to improve governmental processes. She emphasized that the findings from EY's analysis will directly inform the budget proposals put forth by the Johnson administration.This announcement followed a recent investor conference held in Chicago, where city officials provided briefings on the city's financial situation. Notably, this year's investor conference was closed to the media, a departure from past practices. This decision prompted a letter of concern from more than half a dozen news organizations, including Bloomberg News, to CFO Jaworski, requesting access. The media outlets argued that such events are crucial for public understanding of the city's financial priorities, health, and economic outlook. They asserted that closing the conference to the press undermines the transparency that residents and taxpayers deserve, particularly at a time when significant decisions regarding debt, investment, and budget strategy are being made. This lack of transparency raises questions about public access to information during a critical period of fiscal planning for the city.","The engagement of EY signals a proactive approach by the Johnson administration to tackle these substantial budget gaps.

Tesla stock jumps 45% in one month; Elon Musk sends message to Tim Walz: Yo Timmy ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tesla-stock-jumps-45-in-one-month-elon-musk-sends-message-to-tim-walk-yo-timmy-/articleshow/121230204.cms,"When Tim Walz mocked Tesla’s falling shares

Elon Musk's ties with Trump hits on Tesla brand

Tesla shares closed at $349.98 on Friday, capping off a 44.89% surge over the past one month. and boosting the company's market cap to $1.12 trillion. After months of criticism over Tesla’s falling stock price, Elon Musk responded to Tim Walz – former Democratic vice presidential candidate – with a pointed jab of his own. Musk celebrated the gain in Tesla stock on X, sharing a screenshot of Tesla stocks soaring to $347.70. He captioned the post, Kek - a word people online use instead of ""lol"" (laugh out loud).Quoting the post, Tesla CEO Elon Musk pulled back an old post by Tim Walz where he celebrated Tesla's stock struggles at $22. He posed a sarcastic question to the Minnesota Governor, asking “Yo Timmy, how’s your day bro?” with a clown face emoji.Mocking Tesla’s struggles in a post on X earlier this year, Walz wrote: “If you need a little boost during the day, check out Tesla stock.” He also shared a video in which he joked about adding Tesla to the Stocks app on his iPhone to watch its decline, quipping, “225 and dropping.”Taking the joke further, Walz added: “If you own one, we’re not blaming you. You can take dental floss and pull the Tesla thing off, you know.”Musk hit back with a not-so-subtle comment then. He wrote “Sometimes when I need a little boost, I look at the @JDVance portrait in the @WhiteHouse and thank the Lord”. The tech billionaire didn’t stop there. He called Walz a ""huge j**k"" and ""a creep”.Later, Walz took a u-turn on his comment against Tesla stocks, saying hat he was “making a joke”.Elon Musk’s ties to the Trump administration have drawn heavy criticism, casting a shadow over his companies—especially Tesla. The electric vehicle maker has seen its stock drop nearly 40% in 2025, as public protests and backlash mounted over Musk's political involvement. Tesla’s brand has taken a hit in recent months, with demonstrations targeting the company and analysts urging Musk to distance himself from government roles ahead of last month’s earnings call. Some warned the company had suffered “unprecedented brand damage.”Musk’s own fortune took a major blow, falling by nearly $135 billion, or 31% this year. Still, there are signs of recovery, as on Friday, Tesla shares closed just under $350, marking the stock’s fourth straight week of gains.","Tim Walz mocked Tesla's falling stock price in a post on X earlier this year.

India has formally joined the list of more than 120 nations, such as the United States, Canada, France, Japan, and Australia, in issuing biometric e-passports to its citizens. The move is a historic shift in enhancing national security, streamlining international travel, and keeping pace with ICAO international standards. As global travel recovers and border security assumes worldwide priority, India's move to biometric e-passports puts it at the leading edge of the technological transformation of identity management.A biometric e-passport, or an electronic passport or e-passport, is an advanced form of the conventional passport. It combines sophisticated digital technology to embed the passport holder's personal and biometric details safely.The heart of an e-passport is an embedded Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip in the back cover of the booklet. It holds:A small gold rectangle symbol on the cover indicates that the passport is equipped with electronic functionality.Indian nationals can apply for a biometric e-passport either through the Passport Seva Online Portal or in person at a Passport Seva Kendra (PSK) or Post Office Passport Seva Kendra (POPSK).To protect data and conform to international standards, biometric e-passports employ various digital encryption and authentication techniques, such as:These standards are regulated by the ICAO Document 9303, which requires interoperability between nations and provides a seamless international verification.Biometric e-passports offer a greater degree of security than conventional passports. The use of biometric information such as fingerprints and facial recognition ensures that the passport can be used by the owner alone, limiting the possibility of fraud and identity theft.E-passports simplify the immigration process by facilitating automated and contactless identity verification at checkpoints for immigration. This considerably minimizes waiting times at border control points, enhancing the efficiency and minimizing the stress of international travel for commuters.Biometric e-passports adhere to international specifications laid down by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), so they can be used at airports and border checkpoints across the globe. This makes international travel easier, as a large number of countries accept these passports.The sophisticated security mechanisms in biometric e-passports render it challenging for individuals to make changes or replicate passports. This aids in thwarting identity fraud and maintains the passport holder's individual information secure from abuse.E-passports make traveling easier by enabling the user to travel through automated e-gates at airports, without the need for manual inspection. This reduces travel time and makes travel more convenient, particularly at busy travel times.By including biometric information, e-passports promote national security. They enable improved tracking of people crossing borders, and the secure information prevents activities such as illegal immigration and identity theft, improving overall border control mechanisms.With e-passports, it is easier and more convenient to update or renew personal data. The electronically stored data can be readily accessed and updated, such that the renewal process is faster and more streamlined.Biometric e-passports are a major development toward a completely digital system for travel. Their application facilitates the worldwide shift toward paperless travel and digital identities, leading to innovation in international mobility in the future.India's initiative to implement biometric e-passports is a response to the increasing requirement to:The government intends to empower Indian citizens with a travel document that is recognized worldwide for its security, authenticity, and digital features.India rolled out its biometric e-passport project under the Passport Seva Programme 2.0, a technology-driven update of the national passport issuing system. The pilot operation commenced in April 2024, with an intention to focus on selected cities such as:In Tamil Nadu, the issuance of e-passports started at the Regional Passport Office in Chennai on March 3, 2025. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) reported that more than 20,700 e-passports were issued in the state in three weeks of launch.A nationwide rollout is scheduled by mid-2025, with biometric passports to become the default standard for all new and renewed Indian passports.One of the most concrete advantages of biometric e-passports is their capacity to streamline immigration processes. Biometric e-passports enable passengers to travel through e-gates located at global airports, where their identity is confirmed using a contactless biometric chip scan.These kinds of systems are already in place in Singapore, the UAE, and the UK—and India's move to biometric credentials will enable Indian citizens to take advantage of such international infrastructures.All biometric e-passports are manufactured at Nashik's India Security Press, a government-owned industry under the Ministry of Finance. Centralized manufacturing ensures:","India has formally joined the list of more than 120 nations, such as the United States, Canada, France, Japan, and Australia, in issuing biometric e-passports to its citizens.

Netflix to introduce AI-generated ads appearing within shows and movies; here's what the company said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/netflix-to-introduce-ai-generated-ads-appearing-within-shows-and-movies-heres-what-the-company-said/articleshow/121220924.cms,"Representative Image

What Netflix said about the AI-generated ads



“Netflix debuted a new modular framework for ad formats that leverages generative AI to instantly marry advertisers’ ads with the worlds of our shows. This will create a better, more relevant experience for our members and drive the best results. Reinhard unveiled the first capability with interactive midroll and pause formats that build custom advertising creative with added overlays, call to action, second screen buttons, and more to serve the right ad to the right member at the right time. These formats will be available by 2026 in all ad-supported countries.”

“I hope it’s this: the foundation of our ads business is in place. And going forward, the pace of progress is going to be even faster. Plus, we already have the most important thing: the most engaged audience anywhere,”

Netflix has announced it will roll out AI-generated advertising, including pause ads, on its ad-supported tier by 2026. The company is developing a new type of ad that uses AI to integrate advertiser products with Netflix shows and movies. During Netflix’s third Upfront event, the company demonstrated an example by showing how a product image will be placed over a background inspired by Stranger Things. For users on Netflix’s ad-supported plan, this means seeing ads that blend with the content they’re watching. The US-based streaming giant also noted that advertisers can insert these new ad formats in the middle of viewing or display them when users pause. These ads could include an overlay or a call to action when they are introduced by the end of this year.At the event, Amy Reinhard, Netflix’s President of Advertising, noted that the ad-supported plan now has more than 94 million global monthly active users and is used by more 18-34-year-olds than any other US broadcast or cable network. She also noted that ad members in the US are highly engaged, spending an average of 41 hours per month on Netflix.In a blog post, while talking about the AI-generated ads , the company wrote:Reinhard noted.Meanwhile, the company did not specify the targeting methods for these ads, such as watch history or the content being viewed at the time. Also, details about the backend operation and presentation of these ads are currently unknown.

How the shocking kidnapping attempt on crypto CEO's daughter in broad daylight in Paris shows the BIG Crypto problem in Europe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-the-shocking-kidnapping-attempt-on-crypto-ceos-daughter-in-broad-daylight-in-paris-shows-the-big-crypto-problem-in-europe/articleshow/121220669.cms,"France summons cryptocurrency businesses after kidnappings (Photo: AP)

Disturbing trend of family kidnappings

A disturbing trend of kidnappings and extortion attempts targeting cryptocurrency firms and their owners is sweeping across France and other European Union nations, prompting urgent calls for increased governmental protection for individuals within the burgeoning digital asset industry. Authorities are increasingly convinced that these brazen attacks are orchestrated by organized criminal groups employing a chilling new tactic: targeting the families of wealthy cryptocurrency investors and business executives.The core tenet of cryptocurrency ownership, ""not your keys, not your coins,"" which emphasizes individual control over digital assets as a security measure against online theft, has inadvertently created a new vulnerability in the physical world. While storing cryptocurrency in ""cold wallets"" (offline storage) can safeguard against remote hacking, it exposes holders to the ""$\$$5 wrench problem"" – the threat of physical coercion to surrender private keys and, consequently, their digital fortunes. Now, cryptocurrency industrialists and their families are finding themselves alarmingly susceptible to this very scenario.The latest incident unfolded in broad daylight in Paris, where a masked gang attempted to abduct the daughter of Pierre Noizat , the CEO of prominent French cryptocurrency firm Paymium, from a public street. This terrifying event marks at least the third such attack in France in recent months, signaling a dangerous escalation. In January, the co-founder of another leading French crypto company, Ledger, and his wife were brutally kidnapped. Then, in May, the father of a crypto company head was snatched. While all victims in these prior incidents were eventually rescued, both kidnapped fathers tragically suffered the amputation of a finger.In the most recent attack, the husband of Pierre Noizat's daughter bravely fought off the assailants, sustaining a fractured skull in the process, before managing to flee after a quick-thinking shop owner intervened, chasing the attackers away with a fire extinguisher. Reports from Ars Technica indicate that similar attacks have occurred in Belgium and Spain in recent months, suggesting a coordinated effort across multiple European nations. Law enforcement agencies across the continent are actively investigating several of these cases, with growing suspicion that they are linked to sophisticated organized crime networks.In a bid to deter further attacks, investors within the cryptocurrency industry are actively working to raise awareness among criminals about the inherent traceability of most cryptocurrency transactions. While attackers may operate under the misconception that they can coerce victims' families into transferring digital assets to untraceable wallets, the reality is more complex. Cryptocurrency transactions, even those involving privacy-focused coins, leave a digital trail that can be followed by skilled investigators. Indeed, police forces have successfully tracked and apprehended numerous individuals involved in these recent kidnapping and extortion attempts, demonstrating the limitations of anonymity in the blockchain ecosystem. The industry hopes that highlighting these successful arrests and the inherent risks of cryptocurrency-based extortion will serve as a deterrent.French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau addressed the growing concerns this week, stating his intention to meet with French cryptocurrency entrepreneurs to discuss and encourage enhanced personal security measures. However, as of yet, there has been no concrete indication of broader governmental action or the provision of dedicated protection beyond these verbal assurances.For individuals holding their own cryptocurrency investments, these events serve as a stark reminder that while safeguarding digital assets offline can mitigate the risk of hacking, it does not eliminate the threat of real-world exploitation. In this evolving landscape of crypto-related crime, discretion and privacy regarding one's holdings are proving to be increasingly vital. The most prudent strategy, security experts advise, is to maintain a low profile about one's wealth and potential cryptocurrency holdings, as those unaware of your financial status are less likely to target you for extortion.","A disturbing trend of kidnappings and extortion attempts targeting cryptocurrency firms and their owners is sweeping across France and other European Union nations.

"Weeks after Mark Carney's win, Canada's economy appears in crisis; job data at its lowest almost in years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/weeks-after-mark-carneys-win-canadas-economy-appears-in-crisis-job-data-at-almost-its-lowest-in-years/articleshow/121220363.cms,"Trump Tariffs and more: What is causing employment risis in Canada

What job seekers in Canada need to do

Grim Economic Outlook

Newly elected Prime Minister Mark Carney is confronting a significant economic downturn as Canada's labor market shows alarming signs of deterioration, particularly impacting recent graduates. Fresh data reveals a concerning trend of rapidly rising unemployment and sluggish job creation, exacerbating existing economic vulnerabilities just months into Carney's tenure. In April 2025, Canada added a meager 7,400 jobs, a figure far below expectations and insufficient to keep pace with population growth, consequently pushing the national unemployment rate to 6.9%. However, the situation is considerably more severe for young Canadians entering the workforce. The unemployment rate for recent post-secondary graduates has surged to a troubling 11.2%, marking the highest rate at the beginning of a year in at least two decades, according to an analysis of Statistics Canada data by Brendon Bernard, a senior economist at Indeed Canada. This paints a stark and bleak picture for young Canadians attempting to launch their careers, gain financial independence, and secure their long-term financial futures. Indeed, sources like The Globe and Mail are reporting that the current labor market conditions represent the bleakest in decades for this demographic.The delayed economic recovery, significantly hampered by external factors such as the ongoing trade disputes with the United States – involving substantial tariffs on key Canadian exports like steel, aluminum, and automobiles – has dashed earlier hopes for a swift rebound in the labor market following anticipated interest rate adjustments by the Bank of Canada. Economists are increasingly concerned that graduating during such a pronounced economic downturn could have enduring negative consequences on young individuals' career trajectories, potentially leading to prolonged periods of underemployment, slower income growth, and hindered career advancement. “If the recovery is swift, people can regain momentum,” Bernard cautioned, “But right now, it's unclear how long these conditions will persist, and the longer it takes, the greater the potential for lasting damage to their career prospects.”The financial ramifications of this employment crisis for young Canadians are substantial and long-lasting. Protracted delays in securing stable and meaningful employment directly impede their ability to initiate savings and investment early in their careers – a cornerstone of long-term financial security. Certified financial planner Desmond Nwaerondu of Sun Life in Calgary emphasizes the critical impact of delayed savings on retirement goals. He illustrates this with a compelling example: an individual who begins saving $200 per month at age 20 with a hypothetical 4% annual return would accumulate approximately $296,842 by age 65. In contrast, someone who delays saving until age 30, with the same monthly contribution and return, would amass only $180,642 – a difference of over $116,000 due to just a decade of delayed action. This highlights the power of compounding and the significant disadvantage faced by young individuals who are unable to start saving early due to unemployment or underemployment.Despite the challenging economic landscape, experts offer guidance for young job seekers striving to navigate this difficult market. Chris Raper, a portfolio manager at Aspira Wealth (Raymond James Ltd.), advises adopting a pragmatic approach by gaining any form of work experience available, even if it falls outside their immediate field of interest. He argues that these roles, such as camp counseling or positions in the hospitality industry, can be invaluable in developing essential soft skills that are highly valued by employers across various sectors. Furthermore, Raper underscores the growing importance of acquiring high-demand technical skills, particularly in areas like Artificial Intelligence (AI), suggesting the utilization of readily available free online resources such as YouTube for self-directed learning. Networking is also identified as a critical strategy, with professionals recommending active engagement on platforms like LinkedIn and attendance at relevant industry events to build connections and uncover potential opportunities. “You need to get in front of the people working in the industry you want to join,” Raper advises.The broader economic outlook for Canada under Prime Minister Carney's leadership appears increasingly precarious. The combination of high unemployment, particularly among young people, and sluggish overall job growth raises serious concerns about potential economic stagnation. The ongoing trade tensions with the US, manifested in tariffs on key Canadian exports, further exacerbate these challenges by negatively impacting crucial sectors of the Canadian economy. Statistics Canada data indicating that approximately 1.6 million Canadians are currently unemployed underscores the significant strain on the national labor market. The net addition of only 7,400 jobs in April, following a loss of 32,600 jobs in March, highlights the volatile and uneven nature of the current economic recovery, further amplifying anxieties about Canada's economic stability in the face of persistent trade headwinds and a weakening labor market.","In April 2025, Canada added a meager 7,400 jobs, a figure far below expectations and insufficient to keep pace with population growth.

Tim Cook leadership



Also Read |

Since taking the helm as Apple's CEO in 2011, Tim Cook has led the company to historic levels of growth, shifting it from a product-driven pioneer to a multi-trillion-dollar conglomerate. Under Cook's leadership, Apple expanded into new regions, improved operational effectiveness, and recorded unprecedented financial success while maintaining alignment with a vision of simplicity, user privacy, and product excellence.In more recent events, US President Donald Trump publicly called for Apple CEO Tim Cook to move iPhone manufacturing back to America from India. Trump pointed out that Apple must first think about making products locally, even though India had promised to drop tariffs on American products. He again raised the issue of India having high tariff barriers that he feels stand in the way of American business. Trump also praised Apple's ramp-up investment in the manufacturing in America, pointing out a $500 billion pledge and new plant constructions in America going on today.Timothy Donald Cook or Tim Cook was born on November 1, 1960, in Mobile, Alabama, but grew up in the neighbouring town, Robertsdale. His father worked at the shipyard, and his mother was an assistant pharmacist; their house was modest but rooted in work ethic and discipline. Cook graduated second in his high school class and received the ""Most Studious"" award, which is a sign of the hardworking and detail-minded leader that he would grow up to be.Cook received his Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering from Auburn University in 1982, a degree that set him up for his process improvement habit. He later studied for an MBA at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business and graduated as a Fuqua Scholar, an award reserved for the top 10% of students. This unconventional blend of technical and managerial training formed the basis of his distinctive vision as a business executive grounded in analytical capabilities and operating discipline.As of May 2025, Apple CEO Tim Cook's net worth is more than $2 billion, according to a Forbes report. His net worth mainly comes from Apple stock holdings, such as around 3.28 million shares, and performance-based compensation packages. In 2024, Cook's compensation was $74.6 million, including a $3 million base salary, $58.1 million in stock awards, and $12 million in incentives. Unlike technology founders such as Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos, the majority of Cook's fortune is not from ownership positions in the company but from executive pay.After graduate school, Cook worked at IBM, where he spent 12 years overseeing manufacturing and distribution operations in North and Latin America. He gained a high respect for the interaction of the supply chain and scalability of operations.Cook became known for his unconventional but very efficient approach to inventory management. He famously declared that ""inventory is fundamentally evil"" compared to spoiled milk products only worth something when they are fresh. His methods involved lean inventory, rapid product cycles, and just-in-time shipping. Prior to working at Apple, Cook was Compaq's Vice President of Corporate Materials for six months. Though brief, it reminded him he was the industry's top operating mind. Departures from Compaq to struggling Apple stunned peers one likened him to ""a fool"" but Cook was confident.When Cook became an Apple employee in 1998, the company was facing disaster, having only just recorded a $1 billion net loss. Morale was dismal, product planning was in disarray, and the company was generally regarded as a dying star in the technology sector. Cook was not offered a seat by Steve Jobs until persistent overtures by Apple recruiters. He was drawn to Jobs' vision and the potential to make a significant contribution. Hiring Cook as Senior Vice President of Worldwide Operations, Jobs rewarded him with a $400,000 salary and a $500,000 signing bonus—a big bet on an unproven executive at the time.Cook immediately began reengineering Apple's manufacturing and supply chain. Using the same principles of JIT manufacturing he had employed at IBM, Cook minimised inventory, shortened lead times for product shipments, and removed unnecessary waste. Inventory turnover at Apple fell from a few months to five days, releasing capital and allowing for faster product refreshment.During the first year that Cook was on board, Apple generated a $309 million profit and introduced a redesigned iMac. Not only were his practices frugal, but he set Apple up to grow exponentially after it had the blockbuster products of the iPhone and iPod on the market.\When Steve Jobs took medical leaves of absence in 2004 and 2009, Cook performed as acting CEO, overseeing product development cycles and business operations. These times were instrumental in re-scholearing him for full-time duty and cemented his position as Jobs' successor.On August 24, 2011, Jobs stepped down and appointed Cook as his successor as CEO. In his first company-wide memo, Cook was humble and dutiful:Under Cook, Apple experienced exponential financial growth:Cook expanded Apple's hardware lineup with the introduction of:Cook led Apple into digital services, significantly growing its revenue:He also guided the construction of Apple's initial content creation studio, which created award-nominated movies and expanded Apple's ecosystem into media.Unlike Jobs' visionary and dictatorial style, Cook is process-driven, analytical, and collaborative. He empowers cross-functional groups, insists on clear accountability, and insists on high standards without micromanaging. His style has stabilized and broadened the corporate culture. Cook opines that innovation arises from real caring and collaboration. This approach influences everything from product design to project management internally.","Timothy Donald Cook or Tim Cook was born on November 1, 1960, in Mobile, Alabama.

What US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy about the FAA’s current condition



""We do try to buy replacement parts on eBay for this really old equipment. Sometimes, we can't even buy it on eBay, so we're trying to use 3D printing to craft replacement parts for the system that we use.”

""The system we currently use, it truly is 25, 35, 40 years old in some places. We should've paid way more attention to it as a country. We've let it age, and now we're seeing the cracks of that age play out in real time for us,”

“the layoffs and voluntary buyouts … excluded safety positions.”

""We've been hiring air traffic controllers as quickly as we can,""

US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has informed lawmakers that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is purchasing replacement parts on eBay and using 3D printers to manufacture components for its ageing technology systems. This procurement strategy highlights the challenges facing the nation's air safety system, which is currently under review for its older technology and persistent staffing problems. Secretary Duffy disclosed these practices during a Senate hearing, which took place as the Donald Trump administration looks for a major three-year overhaul of the US air traffic control system . This proposed modernisation plan is estimated to cost ""lots of billions"" and would involve replacing hundreds of radars, constructing over a dozen new control towers, and implementing a new telecommunications system.Such an undertaking would likely require Congress to appropriate additional funds for the FAA. Last week, Duffy had stated on ""Meet The Press"" that the FAA has turned to eBay and 3D printing due to the unavailability of new parts for some of the agency's older systems.In the latest Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing, Duffy told members:Duffy added that although US air travel remains safe thanks to “multiple redundancies,” he admitted that the air traffic control system requires an overhaul.Duffy noted.Duffy also rejected claims that recent FAA job cuts jeopardised air safety, noting that while the agency laid off several hundred probationary staff and offered voluntary buyouts,He highlighted that no air traffic controllers were cut, despite concerns from a union that earlier reductions affected mechanics and specialists supporting controllers and inspectors.Duffy said to US lawmakers.The FAA's technological and staffing situations have drawn attention following recent air safety incidents and operational disruptions. These include a January collision between a commercial jet and a military helicopter near Reagan Washington National Airport that resulted in fatalities, and in recent weeks, the FAA facility near Newark Liberty International Airport has experienced staffing shortages and equipment outages, contributing to delays at the airport.","US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has told lawmakers that the FAA is using 3D printing to make replacement parts for its ageing technology systems. This procurement strategy highlights the challenges facing the nation's air safety system, which is currently under review for its older technology and persistent staffing problems.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121218375,imgsize-69050,width-400,resizemode-4/Buying-replacement-parts-on-eBay-making-new-parts-with-3D-printers-and-Transport-secretary-tells-how-deep-FAA-troubles-run.jpg"
